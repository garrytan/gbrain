## 1. Why this exists

`skills/kos-jarvis/` started as a 16-dir extension pack on top of GBrain
to bring KOS v1 capabilities forward (DIKW compile, E0-E4 evidence
gates, 9 KOS page kinds, lint, patrol, MEMORY reflux to OpenClaw, bulk
entity sweep, Feishu/Notion bridges, Gemini embedding shim). Three
months and 12 upstream releases later, GBrain itself shipped a lot
that overlaps. This document maps each fork skill to its v0.25.0
upstream counterpart, classifies the overlap, and lays out a
deprecation timeline with risk register so the fork shrinks instead
of bloats.

The fork README itself codifies the rule: **"扩展应随时间自愿退场,
而非永久膨胀"** (`skills/kos-jarvis/README.md:84`). This plan operationalizes
that rule for the v0.25.0 baseline.

## 2. Scope

In-scope: every directory under `skills/kos-jarvis/` (16 with
SKILL.md + 2 helpers `_lib/` and `templates/`), the deployed launchd
plists that reference them, and the 32 upstream skills shipped in
v0.25.0.

Out-of-scope:
- `kos-compat-api` (`server/kos-compat-api.ts`) — that's the stable
  external HTTP boundary, governed by the [`SESSION-HANDOFF`](.) docs
  separately.
- `workers/notion-poller/` — implementation of `notion-ingest-delta`
  contract; lives outside the skill pack by design.
- `dream-wrap` deletion — even if upstream `gbrain dream` covers most
  of the cycle work, the launchd archive symlink + exit-code
  translation contract is still fork-unique value (see §4 row 4).

## 3. Executive summary

| Bucket | Count | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Keep — fork-unique** | 7 | Permanent or until upstream abstracts the gap |
| **Keep — partial overlap, fork value justified** | 3 | Trim to KOS-unique surface; lean on upstream for the rest |
| **Archive — one-shot done** | 2 | Move to `skills/kos-jarvis/_archive/` after acceptance check |
| **Pilot retire — upstream covers ≥80%** | 1 | Run pilot test, then retire if regression-clean |
| **Spec-only, code lives elsewhere** | 1 | Cross-link to actual implementation, drop SKILL.md |
| **Helpers (no SKILL.md)** | 2 | `_lib/` + `templates/` keep |

Net target: **16 active skill dirs → 11 active + 2 archived + 1 retired**
by next sync (v0.26.0 window).

## 4. Inventory matrix

Columns:
- **Fork skill** — directory under `skills/kos-jarvis/`
- **Wired** — `launchd` (cron), `imported` (TS import), `manual` (CLI
  only), `docs` (no runtime), `one-shot` (already executed once)
- **Upstream cover** — ✓ full / ◐ partial / ○ none
- **Upstream feature** — closest GBrain v0.25.0 equivalent
- **Decision** — see §5 categories
- **Notes** — key tension or rationale

| # | Fork skill | Wired | Cover | Upstream feature | Decision | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `gemini-embed-shim` | retired 2026-05-10 (M3) | ○ | v0.27 native Vercel AI SDK gateway with first-class Google provider | **ARCHIVED** | Cutover validated on Postgres pilot, then 5 plists swapped + 2718 pages re-embedded into native vector space + shim launchd bootout'd. See JARVIS-ARCHITECTURE §6.23. Dir at `skills/kos-jarvis/_archived/gemini-embed-shim/`. |
| 2 | `_lib/brain-db.ts` | imported by 9 fork callers | ○ | `BrainEngine` interface (but heavyweight, MCP-bounded) | **KEEP** unique | Direct PGLite/Postgres reader, bypasses MCP 100-row cap. v0.25.0 added 5 eval-method mirrors as safety net (§6.20). |
| 3 | `feishu-bridge` | docs only — archived 2026-05-05 | ○ | none — OpenClaw integration is fork-specific | **ARCHIVED** | OpenClaw `jarvis-feishu-signal-detector` extension retired 2026-05-05 (downstream `enrich-sweep` never wired to consume the queue, extension was generating garbage). Doc preserved at `skills/kos-jarvis/_archived/feishu-bridge/`. |
| 4 | `dream-wrap` | launchd daily 03:11 | ◐ | `gbrain dream --json` (v0.17+, 8 phases in v0.23) writes its own archive | **KEEP** partial — fork value is launchd-glue + exit-code translation + `latest.json` symlink | Wrap is ~100 lines and survives clean. Fold the archive logic into upstream as a `gbrain dream --archive-dir` flag in a follow-up PR. |
| 5 | `url-fetcher` | imported by `server/kos-compat-api.ts` | ○ | none — upstream `ingest` skill assumes caller fetches | **KEEP** unique | UltimateSearchSkill bridge for X/Twitter + FlareSolverr-protected sites. kos-compat-api specific. |
| 6 | `pending-enrich` | docs (queue schema) — archived 2026-05-05 | ○ | upstream `signal-detector` is per-message inline | **ARCHIVED** | Producer (OpenClaw extension) retired 2026-05-05; consumer (`enrich-sweep`) never wired in cron. Schema doc preserved at `skills/kos-jarvis/_archived/pending-enrich/`. |
| 7 | `digest-to-memory` | manual (planned weekly Sun 22:00, not yet wired in cron) | ○ | none — KOS → OpenClaw `MEMORY.md` 回流 | **KEEP** unique | Cross-system reflux; upstream has no equivalent because OpenClaw is a downstream of the fork. |
| 8 | `enrich-sweep` | launchd weekly Sun 22:13 | ◐ | upstream `enrich` covers per-entity (Tier 1/2/3 via Tavily) | **KEEP** partial — bulk-mode value | SKILL.md self-acknowledges "IS the bulk-mode variant; does not fork the logic, wraps it". Justified. |
| 9 | `orphan-reducer` | manual weekly | ◐ | `gbrain orphans` only **detects**; v0.23 `patterns` phase finds themes, not edges | **KEEP** partial — Haiku-classified active reduction | Different concept from upstream patterns phase; reduces orphan count by inserting typed edges. |
| 10 | `dikw-compile` | manual (designed to run after ingest skills, **not wired**) | ◐ | upstream `auto-link` post-hook on `put_page` exists but uses generic `link_type='related'` | **KEEP** partial — KOS-unique 4 link types (supplements/contrasts/implements/extends) + A/B/C/F compile grade | **Action**: verify wire status; if dormant, decide whether to revive or archive. |
| 11 | `evidence-gate` | manual (designed as `put_page` interceptor, **not wired**) | ◐ | upstream uses `confidence: high\|med\|low` frontmatter | **KEEP** partial — 5-level (E0-E4) per-claim + per-kind threshold is finer-grained | **Action**: same wire-status check as #10. Likely advisory-only today. |
| 12 | `confidence-score` | manual (called by dikw-compile + kos-patrol, both partially wired) | ◐ | overlapping; upstream `enrich` writes `confidence: high\|med\|low` | **KEEP** partial — KOS 4-input formula + compile-grade rollup | Lightweight; keeps as opt-in formula. |
| 13 | `kos-patrol` | launchd daily 08:07 | ◐ | upstream `maintain` covers stale/orphan/dead-link/cross-ref/backlinks/citations/filing/tags; `gbrain doctor` covers health score | **KEEP** trimmed — Phase 5 (dashboard MD) + Phase 6 (digest emit) are fork-unique outputs | Phases 1-4 (inventory/lint/staleness/gap) ~70% covered by `gbrain doctor` + `gbrain orphans` + `maintain`. Migrate where redundant. |
| 14 | `kos-lint` | called by `kos-patrol`; manual standalone | ◐ | 4 of 6 checks covered: frontmatter (`frontmatter-guard`), dup-id (TBD), dead-links (`gbrain doctor`), orphans (`gbrain orphans`) | **PILOT RETIRE** — checks 1+3+4 fold into upstream; checks 5 (weak links) + 6 (evidence gap) are KOS-unique | See §6 pilot plan |
| 15 | `frontmatter-ref-fix` | one-shot manual (already executed, ERRORs 4→0 per TODO) | ◐ | `frontmatter-guard` covers 7 mechanical classes; `gbrain doctor --fix` exists | **ARCHIVE** — task done | `frontmatter-guard` does NOT cover v1-wiki legacy `../X/Y.md` style. Keep dormant in `_archive/` for any future v1-import re-runs. |
| 16 | `slug-normalize` | one-shot manual (already executed, 7 strays renamed) | ✓ | `gbrain frontmatter audit` flags `SLUG_MISMATCH`; `gbrain put` renames | **ARCHIVE** — task done | Backup-safety protocol in SKILL.md is generic, worth preserving as historical reference. |
| 17 | `notion-ingest-delta` | docs (contract only — actual code in `workers/notion-poller/`) | ○ | upstream `ingest` is a router; no Notion-specific delta | **REWRITE-AS-LINK** | SKILL.md is design contract, not runtime. Replace with a 5-line cross-link to `workers/notion-poller/run.ts` + `kos-compat-api /ingest` extension docs. |
| 18 | `templates/` (helper) | reference | ○ | upstream `_brain-filing-rules.md` covers 20-dir MECE | **KEEP** as reference | KOS 9-type page templates; complementary to upstream filing rules. |

## 5. Decision categories

### 5.1 KEEP — unique value (5)

`gemini-embed-shim`, `_lib/brain-db.ts`, `url-fetcher`,
`digest-to-memory`, `templates/`.

(Originally 7. Reduced 2026-05-05 — `feishu-bridge` + `pending-enrich`
moved to ARCHIVED when the upstream OpenClaw `jarvis-feishu-signal-detector`
extension was retired.)

These exist because upstream has zero equivalent, AND that gap is
unlikely to close near-term (provider-abstracted embed needs core
refactor; OpenClaw integration is fork-specific by definition;
templates are KOS-flavor). No timeline action; revisit if upstream
ever lands a competing feature.

### 5.2 KEEP — partial overlap, justified (4)

`dream-wrap`, `enrich-sweep`, `orphan-reducer`, `dikw-compile` /
`evidence-gate` / `confidence-score` (the KOS quality triad).

Each adds a layer upstream doesn't: launchd glue + exit-code map for
dream-wrap; bulk-mode for enrich-sweep; active reduction (not just
detection) for orphan-reducer; KOS 4-link-type vocabulary + 5-level
evidence + compile-grade for the quality triad.

**Required action for the quality triad**: verify they're actually
wired into the ingest pipeline. Fork README (`README.md:30-40`)
claims dikw-compile "Runs after idea-ingest / media-ingest /
meeting-ingestion", but the upstream `ingest` skill is unaware of
fork skills. Either (a) wire via a cron post-step, (b) wire via a
local CLAUDE.md hook, or (c) downgrade to "advisory only, run on
demand". Decision pending.

### 5.3 ARCHIVE — one-shot done (2)

`frontmatter-ref-fix`, `slug-normalize`.

Both ran once, achieved their goal, and have no recurring schedule.
Move to `skills/kos-jarvis/_archive/<skill>/` (preserve git history)
+ add a one-line README pointer at `skills/kos-jarvis/README.md`. If
a similar v1-import wave ever happens again, restore from archive.

### 5.4 PILOT RETIRE — upstream covers ≥80% (1)

`kos-lint`. See §6 for the pilot plan. Net: retire if pilot proves
upstream + small KOS-specific shim covers ≥95% of current ERROR/WARN
output without regression.

### 5.5 REWRITE-AS-LINK — spec migrated (1)

`notion-ingest-delta`. Convert SKILL.md to a 5-line redirect
pointing at `workers/notion-poller/run.ts` (actual implementation)
and `server/kos-compat-api.ts` `/ingest` (the extended endpoint).
The current SKILL.md is just frozen design notes; the code lives
elsewhere.

## 6. Pilot test plan: `kos-lint` ↔ `gbrain doctor` + `frontmatter-guard`

### 6.1 Hypothesis

`kos-lint` 6-check output can be reproduced by:
- Check 1 (frontmatter required fields) → `gbrain frontmatter audit --json`
- Check 2 (duplicate id) → currently no upstream coverage; needs TODO
- Check 3 (dead internal links) → `gbrain doctor` `dead-links` component
  + `gbrain extract links` pass
- Check 4 (orphans) → `gbrain orphans --count`
- Check 5 (weak links) → **NO upstream coverage** — KOS-specific
  (link budget 2-5 / page, type annotation requirement)
- Check 6 (evidence gap) → **NO upstream coverage** — KOS-specific
  (E0-E4 frontmatter)

If checks 5+6 are extracted to a tiny `kos-quality` shim (~150 LOC),
the rest can route to upstream commands.

### 6.2 Pilot procedure

1. **Baseline capture**: run current `kos-lint` (full 6-check) on
   the live brain. Store JSON output: `~/brain/.agent/reports/kos-lint-baseline-<ISO>.json`.
2. **Upstream coverage capture**: run `gbrain frontmatter audit --json`
   + `gbrain doctor --json` + `gbrain orphans --json --count`. Store
   to `~/brain/.agent/reports/upstream-coverage-<ISO>.json`.
3. **Diff analysis**: for each ERROR + WARN in baseline, find the
   corresponding signal in upstream coverage. Tag each as
   `covered_identical` / `covered_equivalent` / `covered_drift` /
   `not_covered`.
4. **Decision matrix**:
   - If `not_covered` ⊆ {check 5, check 6}: extract those two checks
     into `skills/kos-jarvis/kos-quality/` (~150 LOC), retire
     `kos-lint/`.
   - If `not_covered` includes anything else: file the gap as an
     upstream issue (or fork PR), do NOT retire `kos-lint` until
     resolved.
   - If `covered_drift` is significant (different counts on same
     check): investigate which is correct; likely upstream is
     authoritative now.

### 6.3 Pilot acceptance

- Pilot complete when `~/brain/.agent/reports/kos-lint-pilot-decision.md`
  exists, naming the decision (retire / partial / abort) with evidence.
- If retire: `kos-patrol` rewires Phase 2 to call `kos-quality`
  instead of `kos-lint`; SKILL.md updated; old `kos-lint/` archived.

### 6.4 Estimated effort

- Pilot run: 1 h
- Extract `kos-quality` shim (if pilot passes): 2-3 h
- Cron rewire + smoke: 30 min
- Total: ~4 h

## 7. Deprecation timeline

Tied to upstream sync cadence. Each milestone is conditional on
the upstream sync landing cleanly first (no rush).

### Milestone M1 — v0.25.0 baseline (this plan)

- [x] Audit complete (this doc)
- [ ] Wire-status check for `dikw-compile`, `evidence-gate`,
  `confidence-score` (1 h research + decision)
- [ ] Pilot test for `kos-lint` retirement (4 h, see §6)
- [ ] Archive `frontmatter-ref-fix` + `slug-normalize` to
  `skills/kos-jarvis/_archive/` (30 min)
- [ ] Rewrite `notion-ingest-delta/SKILL.md` as 5-line redirect (15 min)

Total fresh effort: ~6 h research + 30 min cleanup. Spread over 1-2
sessions.

### Milestone M2 — v0.26.7 baseline (this sync, 2026-05-04)

**This milestone activated by**: v0.26.7 upstream sync (commit `a2e5e5b`)
landed 25 commits / 8 releases / 9 new upstream skills + admin HTTP
boundary + destructive guard + Operation.scope. Four overlap surfaces
opened that didn't exist at M1.

#### M2-A: `concept-synthesis` ↔ KOS quality triad evaluation — RESOLVED 2026-05-04

**Verdict: RETIRE all three fork triplet skills. PILOT `concept-synthesis`
on `concepts/` (188 pages) next session.**

##### Wire-status evidence (decisive)

Production Postgres probe on 2026-05-04 (post v0.26.7 sync, schema v34):

| Skill | What it would write | Pages with that frontmatter field set | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dikw-compile` | `frontmatter.dikw_layer` (D/I/K/W) | **0 / 2477** (0.00%) | DEAD CODE |
| `evidence-gate` | `frontmatter.evidence_level` (E0-E4) | **1 / 2477** (0.04%, single E2) | EFFECTIVELY DEAD |
| `confidence-score` | `frontmatter.confidence` (high/med/low) | 2470 / 2477 — but **values are hardcoded template strings** in `server/kos-compat-api.ts:454,533`, never written by the script | DEAD CODE (script), KEEP field name (template-controlled) |

Cross-checked: `kos-compat-api.ts` (sole HTTP ingest entry), `workers/`
(notion-poller cron), `kos-patrol/run.ts` — none of these spawn
`bun run skills/kos-jarvis/{dikw-compile,confidence-score,evidence-gate}/run.ts`.
The triplet only runs when invoked manually by CLI. They were never
wired into the production loop they were designed to gate.

The script line at `kos-compat-api.ts:600` mentions "dikw-compile
recommended" in a JSON `next:` hint, but that's a string the API caller
might ignore — not an invocation. `kos-patrol/SKILL.md:100` cross-refs
`confidence-score/SKILL.md` as documentation, but `kos-patrol/run.ts`
doesn't call it either.

##### Concept-synthesis comparison

`concept-synthesis` is **structurally distinct** from `dikw-compile`,
not a 1:1 replacement:

| Axis | `dikw-compile` (fork) | `concept-synthesis` (upstream v0.25.1) |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | Per-page on ingest | Batch sweep over `concepts/` |
| Output | D/I/K/W layer per page | T1/T2/T3/T4 tier per concept + dedup-merged stubs |
| Phases | 1 (LLM scoring) | 4 (dedup + score + LLM-synthesize T1+T2 + cluster) |
| Coverage | All page kinds | `concepts/` only (188 pages in production) |

So even if dikw-compile HAD been wired, concept-synthesis would replace
it for `concepts/` only. Since it WASN'T wired, the migration is
trivial: retire all three, pilot concept-synthesis on the 188 concept
pages, observe Tier distribution, decide whether to wire it into
dream-cycle's patterns or synthesize phase.

##### Execution plan (next session, ~30 min)

- [ ] `mv skills/kos-jarvis/{dikw-compile,confidence-score,evidence-gate} skills/kos-jarvis/_archived/`
- [ ] Strip RESOLVER.md `## KOS-Jarvis extensions` triggers for the three
- [ ] Strip `skills/manifest.json` entries for the three (or mark `archived: true`)
- [ ] Update `server/kos-compat-api.ts:600` hint string: `"dikw-compile recommended"` → `"page is searchable; use \`gbrain dream\` patterns/synthesize for cross-page synthesis"`
- [ ] Pilot run: `gbrain query "type:concept" --limit 200 --json > /tmp/concepts.json`, then invoke `concept-synthesis` skill via Claude/agent on `~/brain/concepts/`, inspect tier output
- [ ] If output is reasonable, file P1 to wire concept-synthesis into dream-cycle (or as a manual `kos-patrol`-tier weekly sweep)
- [ ] Update `JARVIS-ARCHITECTURE.md` §6.21 with retirement record + concept-synthesis pilot result

**Net fork shrinkage from M2-A**: 3 active skill dirs gone (11 → 8).

#### M2-B: `kos-compat-api` ↔ `gbrain serve --http` + thin translator

- [ ] Read `src/commands/serve-http.ts` (v0.26.0 upstream) + admin
  dashboard surface
- [ ] Pilot script: spawn `gbrain serve --http --port 7226`, bridge
  one KOS-v1 endpoint (`/query`) → MCP `tools/call`, measure latency
  + token-passthrough fidelity
- [ ] Decision:
  - **(a) internal MCP-over-HTTP delegation**: `kos-compat-api` keeps
    KOS-v1 contract on `:7225`, internally proxies to upstream HTTP on
    `:7226` via translator layer. Reduces ~500 LOC fork code at the
    cost of 1 process hop.
  - **(b) external migration to MCP-over-HTTP**: Notion Knowledge
    Agent + OpenClaw feishu cron migrate to MCP client SDK. High
    cost; not in our control schedule.
  - **(c) status quo**: keep `kos-compat-api` as-is, observe upstream
    HTTP capabilities, re-evaluate on next sync.
- [ ] If (a) chosen, file P1 implementation (4-6 h)
- [ ] Acceptance: decision recorded; `docs/JARVIS-ARCHITECTURE.md`
  §6.21 (this sync) appends the decision
- **Risk**: scope/auth contracts diverge. Upstream `Operation.scope`
  encodes finer-grained permissions than fork's binary `remote` flag.
  Translator layer must map KOS-v1 `Authorization: Bearer <KOS_API_TOKEN>`
  → admin scope (since `/ingest` writes pages = `scope: 'write'`).

#### M2-C: Phase 4-5 calendar/email import → upstream `archive-crawler`

- [ ] Read `skills/archive-crawler/SKILL.md` v0.25.1 — confirm scan
  format support (Gmail takeout / .ics / mbox / Dropbox / B2)
- [ ] Compare against original Phase 4-5 plan in `docs/JARVIS-NEXT-STEPS.md`
- [ ] Decision:
  - **(a) full replacement**: Phase 4-5 deleted, replaced by
    `archive-crawler.scan_paths:` config + minimal fork preprocessor
    (e.g., IMAP → mbox export script) — saves all the build cost on
    Phase 4-5 fork-local code
  - **(b) hybrid**: archive-crawler handles ingestion; fork handles
    source-specific extraction (e.g., Apple Calendar export)
  - **(c) fork continues**: archive-crawler doesn't fit Lucien's
    sources, build fork-local skill anyway
- [ ] If (a)/(b), rewrite `docs/JARVIS-NEXT-STEPS.md` Phase 4-5
  section as upstream-driven configuration
- [ ] Acceptance: decision recorded; Phase 4-5 plan updated
- **Estimated 1.5 h evaluation** (implementation NOT in M2 scope)

#### M2-D: `Operation.scope` + `.localOnly` migration

- [ ] Audit fork-local code for `OperationContext.remote` consumers:
  `git grep "ctx\.remote\|context\.remote" server/ workers/ skills/kos-jarvis/_lib/`
- [ ] Migrate each call site to `op.scope` + `op.localOnly` checks
- [ ] Acceptance: `git grep` returns zero hits in fork-local code
- [ ] Estimated 1 h total (audit + migration)

#### M2 carry-over from M1

- [ ] If `kos-lint` pilot passed at M1, retire it; cron rewire
- [ ] If `dikw-compile`/`evidence-gate` chose "advisory only" path:
  remove cron-mention from kos-patrol Phase 2; document opt-in CLI
  invocation
- [ ] Audit M2 deltas vs this plan; update §4 matrix

**Net target after M2**: 11 active skill dirs → 7-8 active. Concrete
candidates for retirement / consolidation by end of M2:
- `dikw-compile` → scope-narrowed or fully retired (M2-A)
- `confidence-score` → likely retired (M2-A)
- `kos-lint` → retired (M1 pilot, M2 cron rewire)
- `frontmatter-ref-fix` + `slug-normalize` → archived (M1)
- `notion-ingest-delta` → SKILL.md → 5-line redirect (M1)
- Phase 4-5 (not yet built) → replaced by upstream `archive-crawler` config (M2-C)

### Milestone M3 — provider abstraction (UNLOCKED 2026-05-09 by v0.27.0)

**Status updated 2026-05-10 — M3 milestone CLOSED.**

v0.27.0 shipped `src/core/ai/gateway.ts` (Vercel AI SDK) with
first-class Google embedding provider via `provider:model` config.
Pilot validated 2026-05-10 morning on Postgres-backed throwaway DB
(`gbrain_m3_pilot`); production cutover landed same day.

- [x] Upstream provider abstraction landed (v0.27.0, commit `ee9ceb3`)
- [x] Native Google probe pass (286ms, dim configurable via
  `--embedding-dimensions 1536`)
- [x] Pilot validated end-to-end on throwaway Postgres DB —
  `vector_dims=1536`, English + Chinese retrieval working, shim log
  delta 0 across pilot lifecycle (100% native traffic). See
  `docs/JARVIS-ARCHITECTURE.md` §6.23 for verification details.
- [x] Production cutover (2026-05-10): 5 plists swapped
  (kos-compat-api / dream-cycle / enrich-sweep / kos-patrol / notion-poller)
  to carry `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` + `GBRAIN_EMBEDDING_MODEL=google:gemini-embedding-001` +
  `GBRAIN_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS=1536`; `kos-compat-api` plist additionally
  dropped `OPENAI_BASE_URL` + `OPENAI_API_KEY=stub`.
  `~/.gbrain/config.json` updated to match. All 2718 pages
  (5548 chunks) re-embedded into a clean native vector space via
  `gbrain embed --all`. Shim launchd service bootout'd, dir moved to
  `skills/kos-jarvis/_archived/gemini-embed-shim/`.
- [x] KEEP-unique 5 → 4, fork active **11 → 10**.

### Milestone M4 — v0.26.0 +60d retro

- [ ] Was the consolidation worth it? Compare line counts, cron
  failure rates, and "do I remember what this skill does" check
  before/after.
- [ ] Update fork README's `当前状态` section.

## 8. Risk register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pilot retire of `kos-lint` misses a check upstream silently dropped | Medium | Medium | Diff JSON output rigorously; do not retire if `not_covered` includes anything outside checks 5+6 |
| `dream-wrap` archive logic + upstream's CycleReport diverge after a future `gbrain dream` revision | Low | Low | Wrap reads the documented JSON shape (`CycleReport.schema_version: "1"` is stable per §6.20); add a regression test that pins archive shape |
| Archived `frontmatter-ref-fix` or `slug-normalize` not findable when next v1-import wave happens | Low | Low | Symlink the archived dirs from `skills/kos-jarvis/README.md` "前置工具" section |
| Wire-check on dikw-compile reveals it never ran in production → KOS quality story is fictional | Medium | High | If true, openly document the gap. Either (a) revive via cron, (b) honestly downgrade to "designed but unwired", (c) remove. **Don't pretend it works.** |
| Fork drift on a KEEP skill that becomes unmaintainable | Low | Medium | Cap fork-skill TS to ≤500 LOC; if exceeded, refactor or merge upstream PR |
| Notion-ingest-delta SKILL.md redirect loses design rationale that future contributor needs | Low | Low | Move the design rationale to a brief comment in `workers/notion-poller/run.ts` header before deleting SKILL.md |
| OpenClaw side breaks if `digest-to-memory` schedule slips | Low | Low | OpenClaw's MEMORY 近期层 is append-only; missing a week is invisible. Wire via cron-scheduler when convenient. |

## 9. Out of scope (intentional non-goals)

- **Upstream PR submissions**. This plan identifies overlap; pushing
  fork value back upstream (e.g. a `gbrain dream --archive-dir` flag)
  is a separate workstream gated on PR-acceptance bandwidth.
- **OpenClaw skill refactor**. Even if the fork shrinks, the
  OpenClaw side at `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/knowledge-os/` is
  governed by `feishu-bridge/SKILL.md` separately.
- **Schema migrations**. Fork doesn't ship its own DB migrations;
  all schema follows `garrytan/gbrain` `src/core/migrate.ts`.
- **`brain-db.ts` extraction to upstream**. The 5 eval-method mirror
  in `_lib/brain-db.ts` (added v0.25.0) is fork-internal safety net;
  no plan to push upstream because upstream's `BrainEngine` is the
  canonical surface and BrainDb is consciously the
  bypass-MCP-100-row-cap escape hatch.

## 10. Acceptance criteria

This plan is "complete" when:

- [ ] §4 matrix is reviewed by Lucien (1-pass eyeball, 15 min)
- [ ] M1 milestone TODO checkboxes are filed in
  `skills/kos-jarvis/TODO.md` as P1 items (5 entries)
- [ ] Each KEEP-partial's "wire status verification" has a result
  written into `skills/kos-jarvis/README.md`'s `当前状态` section
- [ ] `kos-lint` pilot decision lands at
  `~/brain/.agent/reports/kos-lint-pilot-decision.md`
- [ ] At least one item from §5.3 (archive) actually moved to
  `skills/kos-jarvis/_archive/`
- [ ] Next session-handoff note links back to this plan as the
  governing document for fork shape decisions

*This plan is a living document. Re-evaluate after every upstream
sync that lands a feature potentially overlapping a fork skill.
Each evaluation should append a dated entry to §7 Milestone log
showing what was reconsidered and why.*
