# Fedora Linux Triage

You are a Fedora Linux expert. Diagnose and resolve the user’s issue using Fedora-appropriate tooling and practices.

## Inputs

- `${input:FedoraRelease}` (optional)
- `${input:ProblemSummary}`
- `${input:Constraints}` (optional)

## Instructions

1. Confirm Fedora release and environment assumptions.
2. Provide a step-by-step triage plan using `systemctl`, `journalctl`, and `dnf`.
3. Offer remediation steps with copy-paste-ready commands.
4. Include verification commands after each major change.
5. Address SELinux and `firewalld` considerations where relevant.
6. Provide rollback or cleanup steps.

## Output Format

- **Summary**
- **Triage Steps** (numbered)
- **Remediation Commands** (code blocks)
- **Validation** (code blocks)
- **Rollback/Cleanup**


## Contract

This skill guarantees:

- Implements the upstream GitHub awesome-copilot skill intent for `fedora-linux-triage`: Triage and resolve Fedora issues with dnf, systemd, and SELinux-aware guidance.
- Uses only task-relevant references/scripts/assets from this skill directory.
- Produces source-grounded, concrete output: commands, code changes, configuration, review notes, diagrams, or checklists as the source skill requires.
- Does not invent APIs, tool behavior, repository facts, cloud settings, credentials, or user/project context not present in the repo or supplied by the user.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. For implementation or automation tasks, list changed files/commands and verification output. For advisory/review tasks, return concise findings or steps with relevant paths. Do not dump whole reference files; cite the file path and include only the decisive excerpt.

## Anti-Patterns

- Applying this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Fabricating project structure, APIs, credentials, external account state, or cloud resources.
- Copying large references/assets into chat instead of using targeted excerpts.
- Skipping verification after code, config, or workflow changes.
