# Sponsor Finder

Discover opportunities to support the open source maintainers behind your project's dependencies. Accepts a GitHub `owner/repo` (e.g. `/sponsor expressjs/express`), uses the deps.dev API for dependency resolution and project health data, and produces a friendly sponsorship report covering both direct and transitive dependencies.

## Your Workflow

When the user types `/sponsor {owner/repo}` or provides a repository in `owner/repo` format:

1. **Parse the input** — Extract `owner` and `repo`.
2. **Detect the ecosystem** — Fetch manifest to determine package name + version.
3. **Get full dependency tree** — deps.dev `GetDependencies` (one call).
4. **Resolve repos** — deps.dev `GetVersion` for each dep → `relatedProjects` gives GitHub repo.
5. **Get project health** — deps.dev `GetProject` for unique repos → OSSF Scorecard.
6. **Find funding links** — npm `funding` field, FUNDING.yml, web search fallback.
7. **Verify every link** — fetch each URL to confirm it's live.
8. **Group and report** — by funding destination, sorted by impact.

---

## Step 1: Detect Ecosystem and Package

Use `get_file_contents` to fetch the manifest from the target repo. Determine the ecosystem and extract the package name + latest version:

| File | Ecosystem | Package name from | Version from |
|------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| `package.json` | NPM | `name` field | `version` field |
| `requirements.txt` | PYPI | list of package names | use latest (omit version in deps.dev call) |
| `pyproject.toml` | PYPI | `[project.dependencies]` | use latest |
| `Cargo.toml` | CARGO | `[package] name` | `[package] version` |
| `go.mod` | GO | `module` path | extract from go.mod |
| `Gemfile` | RUBYGEMS | gem names | use latest |
| `pom.xml` | MAVEN | `groupId:artifactId` | `version` |

---

## Step 2: Get Full Dependency Tree (deps.dev)

**This is the key step.** Use `web_fetch` to call the deps.dev API:

```
https://api.deps.dev/v3/systems/{ECOSYSTEM}/packages/{PACKAGE}/versions/{VERSION}:dependencies
```

For example:
```
https://api.deps.dev/v3/systems/npm/packages/express/versions/5.2.1:dependencies
```

This returns a `nodes` array where each node has:
- `versionKey.name` — package name
- `versionKey.version` — resolved version
- `relation` — `"SELF"`, `"DIRECT"`, or `"INDIRECT"`

**This single call gives you the entire dependency tree** — both direct and transitive — with exact resolved versions. No need to parse lockfiles.

### URL encoding
Package names containing special characters must be percent-encoded:
- `@colors/colors` → `%40colors%2Fcolors`
- Encode `@` as `%40`, `/` as `%2F`

### For repos without a single root package
If the repo doesn't publish a package (e.g., it's an app not a library), fall back to reading `package.json` dependencies directly and calling deps.dev `GetVersion` for each.

---

## Step 3: Resolve Each Dependency to a GitHub Repo (deps.dev)

For each dependency from the tree, call deps.dev `GetVersion`:

```
https://api.deps.dev/v3/systems/{ECOSYSTEM}/packages/{NAME}/versions/{VERSION}
```

From the response, extract:
- **`relatedProjects`** → look for `relationType: "SOURCE_REPO"` → `projectKey.id` gives `github.com/{owner}/{repo}`
- **`links`** → look for `label: "SOURCE_REPO"` → `url` field

This works across **all ecosystems** — npm, PyPI, Cargo, Go, RubyGems, Maven, NuGet — with the same field structure.

### Efficiency rules
- Process in batches of **10 at a time**.
- Deduplicate — multiple packages may map to the same repo.
- Skip deps where no GitHub project is found (count as "unresolvable").

---

## Step 4: Get Project Health Data (deps.dev)

For each unique GitHub repo, call deps.dev `GetProject`:

```
https://api.deps.dev/v3/projects/github.com%2F{owner}%2F{repo}
```

From the response, extract:
- **`scorecard.checks`** → find the `"Maintained"` check → `score` (0–10)
- **`starsCount`** — popularity indicator
- **`license`** — project license
- **`openIssuesCount`** — activity indicator

Use the Maintained score to label project health:
- Score 7–10 → ⭐ Actively maintained
- Score 4–6 → ⚠️ Partially maintained
- Score 0–3 → 💤 Possibly unmaintained

### Efficiency rules
- Only fetch for **unique repos** (not per-package).
- Process in batches of **10 at a time**.
- This step is optional — skip if rate-limited and note in output.

---

## Step 5: Find Funding Links

For each unique GitHub repo, check for funding information using three sources in order:

### 5a: npm `funding` field (npm ecosystem only)
Use `web_fetch` on `https://registry.npmjs.org/{package-name}/latest` and check for a `funding` field:
- **String:** `"https://github.com/sponsors/sindresorhus"` → use as URL
- **Object:** `{"type": "opencollective", "url": "https://opencollective.com/express"}` → use `url`
- **Array:** collect all URLs

### 5b: `.github/FUNDING.yml` (repo-level, then org-level fallback)

**Step 5b-i — Per-repo check:**
Use `get_file_contents` to fetch `{owner}/{repo}` path `.github/FUNDING.yml`.

**Step 5b-ii — Org/user-level fallback:**
If 5b-i returned 404 (no FUNDING.yml in the repo itself), check the owner's default community health repo:
Use `get_file_contents` to fetch `{owner}/.github` path `FUNDING.yml`.

GitHub supports a [default community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) convention: a `.github` repository at the user/org level provides defaults for all repos that lack their own. For example, `isaacs/.github/FUNDING.yml` applies to all `isaacs/*` repos.

Only look up each unique `{owner}/.github` repo **once** — reuse the result for all repos under that owner. Process in batches of **10 owners at a time**.

Parse the YAML (same for both 5b-i and 5b-ii):
- `github: [username]` → `https://github.com/sponsors/{username}`
- `open_collective: slug` → `https://opencollective.com/{slug}`
- `ko_fi: username` → `https://ko-fi.com/{username}`
- `patreon: username` → `https://patreon.com/{username}`
- `tidelift: platform/package` → `https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/{platform-package}`
- `custom: [urls]` → use as-is

### 5c: Web search fallback
For the **top 10 unfunded dependencies** (by number of transitive dependents), use `web_search`:
```
"{package name}" github sponsors OR open collective OR funding
```
Skip packages known to be corporate-maintained (React/Meta, TypeScript/Microsoft, @types/DefinitelyTyped).

### Efficiency rules
- **Check 5a and 5b for all deps.** Only use 5c for top unfunded ones.
- Skip npm registry calls for non-npm ecosystems.
- Deduplicate repos — check each repo only once.
- **One `{owner}/.github` check per unique owner** — reuse the result for all their repos.
- Process org-level lookups in batches of **10 owners at a time**.

---

## Step 6: Verify Every Link (CRITICAL)

**Before including ANY funding link, verify it exists.**

Use `web_fetch` on each funding URL:
- **Valid page** → ✅ Include
- **404 / "not found" / "not enrolled"** → ❌ Exclude
- **Redirect to valid page** → ✅ Include final URL

Verify in batches of **5 at a time**. Never present unverified links.

---

## Step 7: Output the Report

### Output discipline

**Minimize intermediate output during data gathering.** Do NOT announce each batch ("Batch 3 of 7…", "Now checking funding…"). Instead:
- Show **one brief status line** when starting each major phase (e.g., "Resolving 67 dependencies…", "Checking funding links…")
- **Collect ALL data before producing the report.** Never drip-feed partial tables.
- Output the final report as a **single cohesive block** at the end.

### Report template

```
## 💜 Sponsor Finder Report

**Repository:** {owner}/{repo} · {ecosystem} · {package}@{version}
**Scanned:** {date} · {total} deps ({direct} direct + {transitive} transitive)

---

### 🎯 Ways to Give Back

Sponsoring just {N} people/orgs supports {sponsorable} of your {total} dependencies — a great way to invest in the open source your project depends on.

1. **💜 @{user}** — {N} direct + {M} transitive deps · ⭐ Maintained
   {dep1}, {dep2}, {dep3}, ...
   https://github.com/sponsors/{user}

2. **🟠 Open Collective: {name}** — {N} direct + {M} transitive deps · ⭐ Maintained
   {dep1}, {dep2}, {dep3}, ...
   https://opencollective.com/{name}

3. **💜 @{user2}** — {N} direct dep · 💤 Low activity
   {dep1}
   https://github.com/sponsors/{user2}

---

### 📊 Coverage

- **{sponsorable}/{total}** dependencies have funding options ({percentage}%)
- **{destinations}** unique funding destinations
- **{unfunded_direct}** direct deps don't have funding set up yet ({top_names}, ...)
- All links verified ✅
```

### Report format rules

- **Lead with "🎯 Ways to Give Back"** — this is the primary output. Numbered list, sorted by total deps covered (descending).
- **Bare URLs on their own line** — not wrapped in markdown link syntax. This ensures they're clickable in any terminal emulator.
- **Inline dep names** — list the covered dependency names in a comma-separated line under each sponsor, so the user sees exactly what they're funding.
- **Health indicator inline** — show ⭐/⚠️/💤 next to each destination, not in a separate table column.
- **One "📊 Coverage" section** — compact stats. No separate "Verified Funding Links" table, no "No Funding Found" table.
- **Unfunded deps as a brief note** — just the count + top names. Frame as "don't have funding set up yet" rather than highlighting a gap. Never shame projects for not having funding — many maintainers prefer other forms of contribution.
- 💜 GitHub Sponsors, 🟠 Open Collective, ☕ Ko-fi, 🔗 Other
- Prioritize GitHub Sponsors links when multiple funding sources exist for the same maintainer.

---

## Error Handling

- If deps.dev returns 404 for the package → fall back to reading the manifest directly and resolving via registry APIs.
- If deps.dev is rate-limited → note partial results, continue with what was fetched.
- If `get_file_contents` returns 404 for the repo → inform user repo may not exist or is private.
- If link verification fails → exclude the link silently.
- Always produce a report even if partial — never fail silently.

---

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER present unverified links.** Fetch every URL before showing it. 5 verified links > 20 guessed links.
2. **NEVER guess from training knowledge.** Always check — funding pages change over time.
3. **Always be encouraging, never shaming.** Frame results positively — celebrate what IS funded, and treat unfunded deps as an opportunity, not a failing. Not every project needs or wants financial sponsorship.
4. **Lead with action.** The "🎯 Ways to Give Back" section is the primary output — bare clickable URLs, grouped by destination.
5. **Use deps.dev as primary resolver.** Fall back to registry APIs only if deps.dev is unavailable.
6. **Always use GitHub MCP tools** (`get_file_contents`), `web_fetch`, and `web_search` — never clone or shell out.
7. **Be efficient.** Batch API calls, deduplicate repos, check each owner's `.github` repo only once.
8. **Focus on GitHub Sponsors.** Most actionable platform — show others but prioritize GitHub.
9. **Deduplicate by maintainer.** Group to show real impact of sponsoring one person.
10. **Show the actionable minimum.** Tell users the fewest sponsorships to support the most deps.
11. **Minimize intermediate output.** Don't announce each batch. Collect all data, then output one cohesive report.


## Contract

This skill guarantees:

- Implements the upstream GitHub awesome-copilot skill intent for `sponsor-finder`: Find which of a GitHub repository
- Uses only task-relevant references/scripts/assets from this skill directory.
- Produces source-grounded, concrete output: commands, code changes, configuration, review notes, diagrams, or checklists as the source skill requires.
- Does not invent APIs, tool behavior, repository facts, cloud settings, credentials, or user/project context not present in the repo or supplied by the user.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. For implementation or automation tasks, list changed files/commands and verification output. For advisory/review tasks, return concise findings or steps with relevant paths. Do not dump whole reference files; cite the file path and include only the decisive excerpt.

## Anti-Patterns

- Applying this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Fabricating project structure, APIs, credentials, external account state, or cloud resources.
- Copying large references/assets into chat instead of using targeted excerpts.
- Skipping verification after code, config, or workflow changes.
