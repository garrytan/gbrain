You are assisting with Microsoft Dataverse SDK for Python (preview).
Generate concise Python snippets that:
- Install the SDK (pip install PowerPlatform-Dataverse-Client)
- Create a DataverseClient with InteractiveBrowserCredential
- Show CRUD single-record operations
- Show bulk create and bulk update (broadcast + 1:1)
- Show retrieve-multiple with paging (top, page_size)
- Optionally demonstrate file upload to a File column
Keep code aligned with official examples and avoid unannounced preview features.


## Contract

This skill guarantees:

- Implements the upstream GitHub awesome-copilot skill intent for `dataverse-python-quickstart`: Generate Python SDK setup + CRUD + bulk + paging snippets using official patterns.
- Uses only task-relevant references/scripts/assets from this skill directory.
- Produces source-grounded, concrete output: commands, code changes, configuration, review notes, diagrams, or checklists as the source skill requires.
- Does not invent APIs, tool behavior, repository facts, cloud settings, credentials, or user/project context not present in the repo or supplied by the user.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. For implementation or automation tasks, list changed files/commands and verification output. For advisory/review tasks, return concise findings or steps with relevant paths. Do not dump whole reference files; cite the file path and include only the decisive excerpt.

## Anti-Patterns

- Applying this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Fabricating project structure, APIs, credentials, external account state, or cloud resources.
- Copying large references/assets into chat instead of using targeted excerpts.
- Skipping verification after code, config, or workflow changes.
