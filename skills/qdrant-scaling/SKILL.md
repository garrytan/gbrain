# Qdrant Scaling

First determine what you're scaling for:

- data volume
- query throughput (QPS)
- query latency
- query volume

After determining the scaling goal, we can choose scaling strategy based on tradeoffs and assumptions.
Each pulls toward different strategies. Scaling for throughput and latency are opposite tuning directions.


## Scaling Data Volume

This becomes relevant when volume of the dataset exceeds the capacity of a single node.

## Scaling for Query Throughput

If your system needs to handle more parallel queries than a single node can handle,
 then you need to scale for query throughput.

## Scaling for Query Latency

Latency of a single query is determined by the slowest component in the query execution path.
It is in sometimes correlated with throughput, but not always. It might require different strategies for scaling.

## Scaling for Query Volume

By query volume we understand the amount of results that a single query returns. 
If the query volume is too high, it can cause performance issues and increase latency.

Tuning for query volume is opposite might require special strategies.

## Contract

This skill guarantees:

- Implements the upstream GitHub awesome-copilot skill intent for `qdrant-scaling`: Guides Qdrant scaling decisions. Use when someone asks
- Uses only task-relevant references/scripts/assets from this skill directory.
- Produces source-grounded, concrete output: commands, code changes, configuration, review notes, diagrams, or checklists as the source skill requires.
- Does not invent APIs, tool behavior, repository facts, cloud settings, credentials, or user/project context not present in the repo or supplied by the user.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. For implementation or automation tasks, list changed files/commands and verification output. For advisory/review tasks, return concise findings or steps with relevant paths. Do not dump whole reference files; cite the file path and include only the decisive excerpt.

## Anti-Patterns

- Applying this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Fabricating project structure, APIs, credentials, external account state, or cloud resources.
- Copying large references/assets into chat instead of using targeted excerpts.
- Skipping verification after code, config, or workflow changes.
