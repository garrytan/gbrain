# VS Code extension command contribution

This skill helps you to contribute commands in VS Code extensions

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Add or update commands to your VS Code extension

# Instructions

VS Code commands must always define a `title`, independent of its category, visibility or location. We use a few patterns for each "kind" of command, with some characteristics, described below:

* Regular commands: By default, all commands should be accessible in the Command Palette, must define a `category`, and don't need an `icon`, unless the command will be used in the Side Bar.

* Side Bar commands: Its name follows a special pattern, starting with underscore (`_`) and suffixed with `#sideBar`, like `_extensionId.someCommand#sideBar` for instance. Must define an `icon`, and may or may not have some rule for `enablement`. Side Bar exclusive commands should not be visible in the Command Palette. Contributing it to the `view/title` or `view/item/context`, we must inform _order/position_ that it will be displayed, and we can use terms "relative to other command/button" in order to you identify the correct `group` to be used. Also, it's a good practice to define the condition (`when`) for the new command is visible.


## Contract

This skill guarantees:

- Implements the upstream GitHub awesome-copilot skill intent for `vscode-ext-commands`: Guidelines for contributing commands in VS Code extensions. Indicates naming convention, visibility, localization and other relevant attributes, following VS Code extension development guidelines, libraries and good prac
- Uses only task-relevant references/scripts/assets from this skill directory.
- Produces source-grounded, concrete output: commands, code changes, configuration, review notes, diagrams, or checklists as the source skill requires.
- Does not invent APIs, tool behavior, repository facts, cloud settings, credentials, or user/project context not present in the repo or supplied by the user.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. For implementation or automation tasks, list changed files/commands and verification output. For advisory/review tasks, return concise findings or steps with relevant paths. Do not dump whole reference files; cite the file path and include only the decisive excerpt.

## Anti-Patterns

- Applying this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Fabricating project structure, APIs, credentials, external account state, or cloud resources.
- Copying large references/assets into chat instead of using targeted excerpts.
- Skipping verification after code, config, or workflow changes.
