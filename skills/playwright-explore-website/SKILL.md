# Website Exploration for Testing

Your goal is to explore the website and identify key functionalities.

## Specific Instructions

1. Navigate to the provided URL using the Playwright MCP Server. If no URL is provided, ask the user to provide one.
2. Identify and interact with 3-5 core features or user flows.
3. Document the user interactions, relevant UI elements (and their locators), and the expected outcomes.
4. Close the browser context upon completion.
5. Provide a concise summary of your findings.
6. Propose and generate test cases based on the exploration.


## Contract

This skill guarantees:

- Implements the upstream GitHub awesome-copilot skill intent for `playwright-explore-website`: Website exploration for testing using Playwright MCP
- Uses only task-relevant references/scripts/assets from this skill directory.
- Produces source-grounded, concrete output: commands, code changes, configuration, review notes, diagrams, or checklists as the source skill requires.
- Does not invent APIs, tool behavior, repository facts, cloud settings, credentials, or user/project context not present in the repo or supplied by the user.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. For implementation or automation tasks, list changed files/commands and verification output. For advisory/review tasks, return concise findings or steps with relevant paths. Do not dump whole reference files; cite the file path and include only the decisive excerpt.

## Anti-Patterns

- Applying this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Fabricating project structure, APIs, credentials, external account state, or cloud resources.
- Copying large references/assets into chat instead of using targeted excerpts.
- Skipping verification after code, config, or workflow changes.
