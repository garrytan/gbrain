### Test Structure
- Name test files with `.test.ts` or `.test.js` suffix
- Place test files next to the code they test or in a dedicated `__tests__` directory
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Use nested describe blocks to organize related tests
- Follow the pattern: `describe('Component/Function/Class', () => { it('should do something', () => {}) })`

### Effective Mocking
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, etc.) to isolate your tests
- Use `jest.mock()` for module-level mocks
- Use `jest.spyOn()` for specific function mocks
- Use `mockImplementation()` or `mockReturnValue()` to define mock behavior
- Reset mocks between tests with `jest.resetAllMocks()` in `afterEach`

### Testing Async Code
- Always return promises or use async/await syntax in tests
- Use `resolves`/`rejects` matchers for promises
- Set appropriate timeouts for slow tests with `jest.setTimeout()`

### Snapshot Testing
- Use snapshot tests for UI components or complex objects that change infrequently
- Keep snapshots small and focused
- Review snapshot changes carefully before committing

### Testing React Components
- Use React Testing Library over Enzyme for testing components
- Test user behavior and component accessibility
- Query elements by accessibility roles, labels, or text content
- Use `userEvent` over `fireEvent` for more realistic user interactions

## Common Jest Matchers
- Basic: `expect(value).toBe(expected)`, `expect(value).toEqual(expected)`
- Truthiness: `expect(value).toBeTruthy()`, `expect(value).toBeFalsy()`
- Numbers: `expect(value).toBeGreaterThan(3)`, `expect(value).toBeLessThanOrEqual(3)`
- Strings: `expect(value).toMatch(/pattern/)`, `expect(value).toContain('substring')`
- Arrays: `expect(array).toContain(item)`, `expect(array).toHaveLength(3)`
- Objects: `expect(object).toHaveProperty('key', value)`
- Exceptions: `expect(fn).toThrow()`, `expect(fn).toThrow(Error)`
- Mock functions: `expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalled()`, `expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalledWith(arg1, arg2)`


## Contract

This skill guarantees:

- Implements the upstream GitHub awesome-copilot skill intent for `javascript-typescript-jest`: Best practices for writing JavaScript/TypeScript tests using Jest, including mocking strategies, test structure, and common patterns.
- Uses only task-relevant references/scripts/assets from this skill directory.
- Produces source-grounded, concrete output: commands, code changes, configuration, review notes, diagrams, or checklists as the source skill requires.
- Does not invent APIs, tool behavior, repository facts, cloud settings, credentials, or user/project context not present in the repo or supplied by the user.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. For implementation or automation tasks, list changed files/commands and verification output. For advisory/review tasks, return concise findings or steps with relevant paths. Do not dump whole reference files; cite the file path and include only the decisive excerpt.

## Anti-Patterns

- Applying this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Fabricating project structure, APIs, credentials, external account state, or cloud resources.
- Copying large references/assets into chat instead of using targeted excerpts.
- Skipping verification after code, config, or workflow changes.
