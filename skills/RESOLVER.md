# GBrain Skill Resolver

This is the dispatcher. Skills are the implementation. **Read the skill file before acting.** If two skills could match, read both. They are designed to chain (e.g., ingest then enrich for each entity).

## Always-on (every message)

| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| Every inbound message (spawn parallel, don't block) | `skills/signal-detector/SKILL.md` |
| Any brain read/write/lookup/citation | `skills/brain-ops/SKILL.md` |

## Brain operations

| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| "What do we know about", "tell me about", "search for", "who is", "background on", "notes on" | `skills/query/SKILL.md` |
| "Who knows who", "relationship between", "connections", "graph query" | `skills/query/SKILL.md` (use graph-query) |
| Creating/enriching a person or company page | `skills/enrich/SKILL.md` |
| Where does a new file go? Filing rules | `skills/repo-architecture/SKILL.md` |
| Fix broken citations in brain pages | `skills/citation-fixer/SKILL.md` |
| "citation audit", "check citations", "fix citations" | `skills/citation-fixer/SKILL.md` (focused fix). For broader brain health, chain into `skills/maintain/SKILL.md` |
| "Research", "track", "extract from email", "investor updates", "donations" | `skills/data-research/SKILL.md` |
| Share a brain page as a link | `skills/publish/SKILL.md` |
| "validate frontmatter", "check frontmatter", "fix frontmatter", "frontmatter audit", "brain lint" | `skills/frontmatter-guard/SKILL.md` |

## Content & media ingestion

| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| User shares a link, article, tweet, or idea | `skills/idea-ingest/SKILL.md` |
| Video, audio, PDF, book, YouTube, screenshot | `skills/media-ingest/SKILL.md` |
| Meeting transcript received | `skills/meeting-ingestion/SKILL.md` |
| Generic "ingest this" (auto-routes to above) | `skills/ingest/SKILL.md` |

## Thinking skills (from GStack)

| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| "Brainstorm", "I have an idea", "office hours" | GStack: office-hours |
| "Review this plan", "CEO review", "poke holes" | GStack: ceo-review |
| "Debug", "fix", "broken", "investigate" | GStack: investigate |
| "Retro", "what shipped", "retrospective" | GStack: retro |

> These skills come from GStack. If GStack is installed, the agent reads them directly.
> If not, brain-only mode still works (brain skills function without thinking skills).

## Operational

| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| Task add/remove/complete/defer/review | `skills/daily-task-manager/SKILL.md` |
| Morning prep, meeting context, day planning | `skills/daily-task-prep/SKILL.md` |
| Daily briefing, "what's happening today" | `skills/briefing/SKILL.md` |
| Cron scheduling, quiet hours, job staggering | `skills/cron-scheduler/SKILL.md` |
| Save or load reports | `skills/reports/SKILL.md` |
| "Create a skill", "improve this skill" | `skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md` |
| "Skillify this", "is this a skill?", "make this proper" | `skills/skillify/SKILL.md` |
| "Is gbrain healthy?", morning health check, skillpack-check | `skills/skillpack-check/SKILL.md` |
| Post-restart health + auto-fix, "did the container restart break anything", smoke test | `skills/smoke-test/SKILL.md` |
| Cross-modal review, second opinion | `skills/cross-modal-review/SKILL.md` |
| "Validate skills", skill health check | `skills/testing/SKILL.md` |
| Webhook setup, external event processing | `skills/webhook-transforms/SKILL.md` |
| "Spawn agent", "background task", "parallel tasks", "steer agent", "pause/resume agent", "gbrain jobs submit", "submit a gbrain job", "submit a shell job", "shell job" | `skills/minion-orchestrator/SKILL.md` |

## Setup & migration

| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| "Set up GBrain", first boot | `skills/setup/SKILL.md` |
| "Migrate from Obsidian/Notion/Logseq" | `skills/migrate/SKILL.md` |
| Brain health check, maintenance run | `skills/maintain/SKILL.md` |
| "Extract links", "build link graph", "populate timeline" | `skills/maintain/SKILL.md` (extraction sections) |
| "Brain health", "what features am I missing", "brain score" | Run `gbrain features --json` |
| "Set up autopilot", "run brain maintenance", "keep brain updated" | Run `gbrain autopilot --install --repo ~/brain` |
| Agent identity, "who am I", customize agent | `skills/soul-audit/SKILL.md` |
| "Populate links", "extract links", "backfill graph" | `skills/maintain/SKILL.md` (graph population phase) |
| "Populate timeline", "extract timeline entries" | `skills/maintain/SKILL.md` (graph population phase) |

## Identity & access (always-on)

| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| Non-owner sends a message | Check `ACCESS_POLICY.md` before responding |
| Agent needs to know its identity/vibe | Read `SOUL.md` |
| Agent needs user context | Read `USER.md` |
| Operational cadence (what to check and when) | Read `HEARTBEAT.md` |

## Disambiguation rules

When multiple skills could match:
1. Prefer the most specific skill (meeting-ingestion over ingest)
2. If the user mentions a URL, route by content type (link → idea-ingest, video → media-ingest)
3. If the user mentions a person/company, check if enrich or query fits better
4. Chaining is explicit in each skill's Phases section
5. When in doubt, ask the user

## Conventions (cross-cutting)

These apply to ALL brain-writing skills:
- `skills/conventions/quality.md` — citations, back-links, notability gate
- `skills/conventions/brain-first.md` — check brain before external APIs
- `skills/conventions/subagent-routing.md` — when to use Minions vs inline work
- `skills/_brain-filing-rules.md` — where files go
- `skills/_output-rules.md` — output quality standards
