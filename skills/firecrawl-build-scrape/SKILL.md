# Firecrawl Build Scrape

Use this when the application already has the URL and needs content from one page.

## Use This When

- the feature starts from a known URL
- you need page content for retrieval, summarization, enrichment, or monitoring
- you want the default extraction primitive before considering `/interact`

## Default Recommendations

- Return `markdown` unless the feature truly needs another format.
- Use `onlyMainContent` for article-like pages where nav and chrome add noise.
- Add waits or other rendering options only when the page needs them.

## Common Product Patterns

- knowledge ingestion from known URLs
- enrichment from a company, product, or docs page
- pricing, changelog, and documentation extraction
- page-level quality checks or monitoring

## Escalation Rules

- If you do not have the URL yet, start with [firecrawl-build-search](../firecrawl-build-search/SKILL.md).
- If content requires clicks, typing, or multi-step navigation, escalate to [firecrawl-build-interact](../firecrawl-build-interact/SKILL.md).

## Implementation Notes

- Keep the integration narrow: one feature, one URL, one extraction contract.
- Treat `/scrape` as the default primitive for downstream LLM or indexing pipelines.
- Request richer formats only when the consumer needs them, such as links, screenshots, or branding data.

## Contract
- Inputs: skill request + project context (and Firecrawl API key when calling live endpoints).
- Outputs: concrete integration guidance, code snippets, and endpoint choices that match Firecrawl docs.
- Failure modes: missing API key, wrong endpoint for the task, or out-of-scope one-off terminal scrapes (use firecrawl CLI skill instead when applicable).

## Output Format
1. Confirm the target endpoint(s) and why they fit.
2. Provide the minimal working code/config changes.
3. Call out auth/env requirements and common pitfalls.

## Anti-Patterns
- Do not invent Firecrawl endpoints or response fields.
- Do not hardcode live API keys into source.
- Do not recommend crawl when a single `/scrape` or `/search` call is enough.
- Do not use these product-integration skills for disposable terminal-only lookups when a CLI path is intended.
