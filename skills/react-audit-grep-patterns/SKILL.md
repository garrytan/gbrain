description: 'Provides the complete, verified grep scan command library for auditing React codebases before a React 18.3.1 or React 19 upgrade. Use this skill whenever running a migration audit - for both the react18-auditor and react19-auditor agents. Contains every grep pattern needed to find deprecated APIs, removed APIs, unsafe lifecycle methods, batching vulnerabilities, test file issues, dependency conflicts, and React 19 specific removals. Always use this skill when writing audit scan commands - do not rely on memory for grep syntax, especially for the multi-line async setState patterns which require context flags.'

# React Audit Grep Patterns

Complete scan command library for React 18.3.1 and React 19 migration audits.

## Usage

Read the relevant section for your target:
- **`references/react18-scans.md`** - all scans for React 16/17 → 18.3.1 audit
- **`references/react19-scans.md`** - all scans for React 18 → 19 audit
- **`references/test-scans.md`** - test file specific scans (used by both auditors)
- **`references/dep-scans.md`** - dependency and peer conflict scans

## Base Patterns Used Across All Scans

```bash
# Standard flags used throughout:
# -r = recursive
# -n = show line numbers
# -l = show filenames only (for counting affected files)
# --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" = JS/JSX files only
# | grep -v "\.test\.\|\.spec\.\|__tests__" = exclude test files
# | grep -v "node_modules" = safety (usually handled by not scanning node_modules)
# 2>/dev/null = suppress "no files found" errors

# Source files only (exclude tests):
SRC_FLAGS='--include="*.js" --include="*.jsx"'
EXCLUDE_TESTS='grep -v "\.test\.\|\.spec\.\|__tests__"'

# Test files only:
TEST_FLAGS='--include="*.test.js" --include="*.test.jsx" --include="*.spec.js" --include="*.spec.jsx"'
```


## Contract

This skill guarantees:

- Implements the upstream GitHub awesome-copilot skill intent for `react-audit-grep-patterns`: Provides the complete, verified grep scan command library for auditing React codebases before a React 18.3.1 or React 19 upgrade. Use this skill whenever running a migration audit - for both the react18-auditor and react
- Uses only task-relevant references/scripts/assets from this skill directory.
- Produces source-grounded, concrete output: commands, code changes, configuration, review notes, diagrams, or checklists as the source skill requires.
- Does not invent APIs, tool behavior, repository facts, cloud settings, credentials, or user/project context not present in the repo or supplied by the user.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. For implementation or automation tasks, list changed files/commands and verification output. For advisory/review tasks, return concise findings or steps with relevant paths. Do not dump whole reference files; cite the file path and include only the decisive excerpt.

## Anti-Patterns

- Applying this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Fabricating project structure, APIs, credentials, external account state, or cloud resources.
- Copying large references/assets into chat instead of using targeted excerpts.
- Skipping verification after code, config, or workflow changes.
