Also use when debugging production issues that require metric analysis."

# Qdrant Monitoring

Qdrant monitoring allows tracking performance and health of your deployment, and identifying issues before they become outages. First determine whether you need to set up monitoring or diagnose an active issue.

- Understand available metrics [Monitoring docs](https://search.qdrant.tech/md/documentation/operations/monitoring/)


## Monitoring Setup

Prometheus scraping, health probes, Hybrid Cloud specifics, alerting, and log centralization. [Monitoring Setup](setup/SKILL.md)


## Debugging with Metrics

Optimizer stuck, memory growth, slow requests. Using metrics to diagnose active production issues. [Debugging with Metrics](debugging/SKILL.md)


## Contract

This skill guarantees:

- Implements the upstream GitHub awesome-copilot skill intent for `qdrant-monitoring`: Guides Qdrant monitoring and observability setup. Use when someone asks
- Uses only task-relevant references/scripts/assets from this skill directory.
- Produces source-grounded, concrete output: commands, code changes, configuration, review notes, diagrams, or checklists as the source skill requires.
- Does not invent APIs, tool behavior, repository facts, cloud settings, credentials, or user/project context not present in the repo or supplied by the user.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. For implementation or automation tasks, list changed files/commands and verification output. For advisory/review tasks, return concise findings or steps with relevant paths. Do not dump whole reference files; cite the file path and include only the decisive excerpt.

## Anti-Patterns

- Applying this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Fabricating project structure, APIs, credentials, external account state, or cloud resources.
- Copying large references/assets into chat instead of using targeted excerpts.
- Skipping verification after code, config, or workflow changes.
