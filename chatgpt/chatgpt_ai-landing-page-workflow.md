between the new figa mcp and the new google stitch with mcp and then gpt 5.4 and gstack which has design skills to generate designs with oepn ai api. and everything else out there like figma make. whats the best way to create a worldcalss landing page witout a human.

I’m checking the current capabilities of the tools you named and comparing them against the broader 2026 landscape, then I’ll give you a concrete stack and workflow.

I’ve confirmed the core pieces are real and current. The important distinction is design canvas tools versus code-producing agents versus opinionated workflow packs; that changes the recommendation.

Mr. White,

The highest-ceiling workflow today is **Google Stitch for concept generation, then GPT-5.4/Codex with Figma MCP for implementation and refinement, then gstack as the final landing-page audit**. Stitch is now an AI-native design canvas with a design agent, DESIGN.md, and MCP/SDK support for moving designs into the rest of your workflow. GPT-5.4 is OpenAI’s strongest current model for polished frontend work, and Codex can turn references into responsive UI, inspect the result in a real browser, compare against screenshots/Figma, and iterate. Figma’s MCP server now lets agents read design context and also write directly to Figma via `use_figma`. gstack is useful as a review layer because its landing-page skill encodes concrete anti-slop rules. citeturn489619view0turn478908view4turn478908view5turn478908view6turn478908view7turn922102view0turn478908view0

The reason this beats a one-tool workflow is quality control. OpenAI’s frontend guide says underspecified prompts tend to fall back to generic, overrepresented patterns. gstack’s audit codifies the exact failure modes that make AI landing pages look cheap: purple gradients, centered-everything, the symmetric 3-column feature grid, generic hero copy, and cookie-cutter section rhythm. A world-class result comes from separating **exploration**, **build**, and **critique**. citeturn478908view4turn478908view0

Use the stack like this. First, use **Stitch** to generate many hero directions and page concepts from your positioning, emotional tone, and references; it is explicitly built for rapid exploration from natural language and parallel idea development. Second, pick one direction and hand it to **Codex/GPT-5.4** with your screenshots, copy, and brand constraints so it builds the real page, checks it across breakpoints, and iterates visually. Third, use **Figma MCP** to move between code and canvas where needed, especially for visual polish and design-system alignment. Fourth, run the result through the **gstack landing-page rubric** and keep cutting generic sections until the page has one clear visual anchor, one job per section, strong first-screen brand clarity, and intentional motion. citeturn489619view0turn478908view6turn478908view7turn922102view0turn478908view0

Use **Figma Make** instead when you already have a real design system. Figma’s new Make kits and attachments let it start from code packages, tokens, variables, PRDs, brand docs, images, and other project files, which makes its outputs more production-aligned than blind prompting. Pair that with **Figma Sites** when speed matters more than absolute ceiling, since Figma Sites is built to design, prototype, and publish responsive websites inside the Figma workflow. citeturn478908view8turn922102view2turn478908view9turn876692search6

For single-tool alternatives: **v0** is the best code-first all-in-one option because it generates working apps/sites, syncs to GitHub, and deploys quickly; **Webflow AI** is strongest for marketing operations because it combines site generation with copy, code, SEO/AEO, CMS, and conversion-oriented tooling; **Framer AI** is the fastest path to a polished editable site shell; **Builder.io** is strong when you need on-brand landing pages tied to an existing design system and experimentation stack. citeturn886084view1turn886084view0turn886084view2turn886084view3turn886084view4

My direct recommendation: **Stitch → Codex/GPT-5.4 + Figma MCP → gstack → deploy custom code**. That is the best path for a founder who wants a world-class landing page without hiring a designer or frontend engineer. **Figma Make + Figma Sites** is the best Figma-native shortcut. **v0** is the best one-box code-first fallback. citeturn489619view0turn478908view4turn478908view5turn922102view0turn922102view2turn886084view1
