Mr. White — the Drizzle step is failing because **`DATABASE_URL` isn’t actually present in the CI job that runs `drizzle`**. Neon’s integration (and the Vercel integration) doesn’t magically inject `DATABASE_URL` into *GitHub Actions*; you must pass it explicitly from the Neon action outputs (or from a secret/var) into the step that runs Drizzle. Neon’s own examples show the create-branch action **emits** the DB URLs as outputs (`db_url`, `db_url_with_pooler`) for you to wire into later steps. citeturn0search4turn0search18

# The 4 common causes (and fixes)

1) **The Drizzle job never receives `DATABASE_URL`**  
   - Fix: make the Drizzle step **depend on** your Neon `create-branch` job and **set the env** from its outputs:  
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     create_neon_branch:
       outputs:
         db_url: ${{ steps.create.outputs.db_url }}
     drizzle_check:
       needs: create_neon_branch
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Drizzle check
           run: pnpm drizzle:check
           env:
             DATABASE_URL: ${{ needs.create_neon_branch.outputs.db_url }}
   ```  
   (Neon’s action provides those outputs; you must pass them through.) citeturn0search4

2) **PRs from forks don’t get your secrets** (Neon API key / project vars), so the branch can’t be created → no URL for Drizzle  
   - Fix: skip Neon/Drizzle on forked PRs (or require manual approval), or switch to `pull_request_target` very carefully (security trade-offs). GitHub blocks secrets on forked PRs by design. citeturn0search1turn0search10

3) **You’re relying on Vercel envs** (Neon→Vercel preview flow) but running Drizzle inside GitHub Actions  
   - Vercel envs don’t flow back into Actions; you must pass the URL in the workflow (or store a preview DB URL in GitHub Secrets/Vars). Neon’s examples that “update Vercel envs for each preview” are separate from Actions. citeturn0search22turn0search14

4) **`drizzle.config.ts` isn’t loading envs in CI**  
   - Drizzle Kit expects a URL from env; ensure your config imports dotenv **and** that the Actions step actually sets the env at runtime. citeturn0search17turn0search21

# A clean, working pattern for you

- **PR workflow** (targeting `preview`):  
  1) Create Neon PR branch → get outputs.  
  2) **Run Drizzle against the PR branch** using the **non-pooler** `db_url` (Neon advises using the emitted DB URL for migrations; don’t log it).  
  3) Run the app/tests using the **pooler** URL if you need a runtime connection. citeturn0search8  
  ```yaml
  - name: Create Neon Branch
    id: create
    uses: neondatabase/create-branch-action@v5
    with:
      project_id: ${{ vars.NEON_PROJECT_ID }}
      branch_name: preview/pr-${{ github.event.number }}
      parent: preview
      api_key: ${{ secrets.NEON_API_KEY }}

  - name: Drizzle migrations/check (PR DB)
    run: pnpm drizzle:check
    env:
      DATABASE_URL: ${{ steps.create.outputs.db_url }}   # use non-pooler for schema ops
  ```
  (Neon’s docs: the action **creates the branch** and **outputs** the URLs for you to use.) citeturn0search4

- **Guard for forks** (no secrets):  
  ```yaml
  if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork == false
  ```  
  Or require approval for forked runners before attempting Neon actions. citeturn0search1

- **Post-merge to `preview`**: run Drizzle against the long-lived **`preview`** DB using a **repo secret/var** (`PREVIEW_DATABASE_URL`) or via a Neon action that fetches the URL, then **reset `preview` to production** after promotion as we set up. citeturn0search8

# Quick diagnostic checklist (hit these and it’ll pass)

- Does the step running `pnpm drizzle:check` actually have `env.DATABASE_URL`? (Echo a masked presence check, not the value.)  
- Does that job **need** the Neon create step (same workflow), not a different workflow? Outputs don’t cross workflows. citeturn0search2  
- Is the PR from a fork? If yes, **secrets aren’t available** → branch creation fails → no URL. Gate with an `if:`. citeturn0search1  
- Is your Drizzle config loading envs (`import 'dotenv/config'`) and not relying on `.env` inside Actions? (Actions don’t read `.env` unless you tell them.) citeturn0search17turn0search21

If you paste your Drizzle job snippet here, I’ll rewrite it so `DATABASE_URL` is wired correctly and guarded for forks.


We have a wildcard, asterix.preview.gov.ie. The idea was to have Vercel... Our name servers point to Vercel. Vercel is hosting our DNS. The idea is to have all of the preview... The main preview branch is attached to preview.gov.ie, and the idea is to have all of the preview branches that Vercel deploys other than the primary preview branch. So all the feature branches that we create get their own Vercel domain, but we want them to be on the gov.ie domain so that we can use one clerk account with everything coming off the same domain. So I wanted to alias the subdomain of wildcard asterix.preview.gov.ie. I want to alias the feature branch Vercel deployment links to that. If you want to do a custom suffix thing or something, it charges $150 a month just to get the Vercel links through Vercel to be on the primary domain, which would be absurdly expensive considering nothing in our CI is costing us any money right now. What would be our option for auto-applying? How can we get around that?


Mr. White — here’s the straight dope.

You’re bumping into Vercel’s paid feature: **Preview Deployment Suffix** (puts every preview under your own domain). It’s a **Pro add-on ($150/mo)**. That’s why the native “branch previews on *.preview.gov.ie” path looks expensive. citeturn0search10turn1search2

Good news: we can get the behavior you want **without** that add-on.

# What Clerk needs
Clerk will share prod settings across previews if the previews live on **subdomains of the same root domain** (e.g., `feature-a.preview.gov.ie`). That’s exactly your plan. citeturn0search2

# Your cheapest workable options

## Option A — Pay Vercel for the suffix (zero engineering)
Turn on **Preview Deployment Suffix** and point `*.preview.gov.ie` at Vercel DNS. Done. (But you already called this out as too pricey.) citeturn1search2turn0search10

## Option B — DIY edge proxy on Vercel (recommended, $0 infra)
Use a tiny **proxy project** on Vercel that owns `*.preview.gov.ie`. It reads the **subdomain**, derives the branch name, and **rewrites** to the corresponding Vercel **branch preview URL** for your real app.

- Vercel supports **external rewrites** and **Edge Middleware** (free) to do this. citeturn2search0turn2search1turn2search4  
- Branch previews already have **deterministic “branch-specific” URLs** (no random hash) that you can construct as `https://<project>-git-<branch>-<account>.vercel.app` (Vercel calls these “Generated URLs”). citeturn1search8turn1search18  
- Keep your nameservers on **Vercel DNS** and add a **wildcard domain** `*.preview.gov.ie` to the proxy project. citeturn1search3

**How it works (flow):**  
`feature-a.preview.gov.ie` → hits proxy project → middleware parses `feature-a` → rewrite to `https://<project>-git-feature-a-<account>.vercel.app` → browser URL stays on `feature-a.preview.gov.ie`, which satisfies Clerk (same root domain). citeturn2search0

**Skeleton code (proxy project):**
```ts
// middleware.ts (Edge Runtime)
export default function middleware(req: Request) {
  const url = new URL(req.url);
  const host = url.hostname;            // e.g. feature-a.preview.gov.ie
  const [branch] = host.split('.');     // "feature-a" (apply your own sanitize)
  const project = process.env.VERCEL_PROJECT!;
  const account = process.env.VERCEL_ACCOUNT!; // your team slug

  // Construct branch preview URL: project-git-branch-account.vercel.app
  const target = `https://${project}-git-${branch}-${account}.vercel.app${url.pathname}${url.search}`;
  return new Response(null, { status: 307, headers: { Location: target } }); // or use a rewrite response
}
export const config = { matcher: ['/((?!_next|favicon.ico).*)'] };
```
…and/or use `vercel.json` **external rewrites** if you prefer config over code. citeturn2search3turn2search0

> Notes:
> - Branch name sanitation: Vercel normalizes branch names in the URL (e.g., slashes → dashes). Match that in middleware.  
> - If you want bullet-proof mapping (handles edge cases/renames), the proxy can call Vercel’s Deployments API to look up the latest **branch URL** and cache the result (Edge Config). But the simple “generated URL” pattern usually suffices. citeturn1search18

## Option C — Cloudflare Worker as the proxy (also cheap/free)
If you prefer **Cloudflare** in front of DNS, a Worker on `*.preview.gov.ie` can proxy to the same Vercel branch URLs using the exact mapping. Functionally identical to Option B; just lives on Cloudflare’s edge instead of Vercel’s. (Plenty of teams do this to avoid platform add-ons.) citeturn0search12

# Setup checklist (Option B)

1) **Create a new “preview-proxy” project on Vercel** (tiny Next/Edge app).  
2) In this project, add domain **`*.preview.gov.ie`** (wildcard) — keep **Vercel DNS**. citeturn1search3  
3) Add **Edge Middleware** that maps subdomain → branch → **rewrite/redirect** to your main project’s **branch preview URL**. citeturn2search4turn2search0  
4) Set env vars `VERCEL_PROJECT` and `VERCEL_ACCOUNT` (team slug).  
5) Point your **main preview** branch (the `preview` branch itself) to the **apex** `preview.gov.ie` using standard “assign domain to Git branch” in project settings. citeturn0search1  
6) Verify Clerk sessions work across `*.preview.gov.ie` (same root) per Clerk’s guidance. citeturn0search2

# Trade-offs & caveats
- Vercel’s paid **suffix** is zero-maintenance; the DIY proxy is a dozen lines of code you own.  
- If your branch naming has slashes or caps, mirror Vercel’s sanitization to build the correct `project-git-<branch>-<account>.vercel.app` hostname. (Test with a couple of real branches.) citeturn1search8  
- External rewrites/Edge Middleware are officially supported and free to use; you just pay normal Vercel usage (which you’re already within). citeturn2search1turn2search4

# Bottom line
- Paying $150/mo for the suffix is optional.  
- **Use a wildcard on `*.preview.gov.ie` + tiny Vercel edge proxy** to route subdomains to the corresponding branch preview. You’ll meet **Clerk’s same-root** requirement and keep costs at $0. citeturn0search2turn1search2

If you want, I’ll deliver the ready-to-drop **proxy repo** (middleware + sanity tests + deployment notes) so you can plug in your `project` and `account` values and go.

Vercel is creating branches on NEON. Is that interfering with GitHub Actions?


Short answer: they don’t “interfere,” but running **both** the Vercel→Neon integration **and** your GitHub Actions branch-creator will cause **duplication & drift** unless you pick one owner of the DB-branch lifecycle.

Here’s what’s happening:

- **Vercel × Neon integration** can auto-create a **Neon branch per preview deployment** and inject `DATABASE_URL` into the Vercel preview env. Naming is typically like `preview-pr-142`. This runs entirely on Vercel’s side. citeturn0search11turn0search0turn0search6  
- **GitHub Actions** (Neon’s `create-branch-action`) also creates per-PR branches and exposes `db_url`/`db_url_with_pooler` outputs for CI steps (migrations/tests). If a branch **already exists with that name**, the action will just return it (idempotent). citeturn0search2turn0search1

Where problems creep in:

- **Two automations creating branches** → you may end up with **two different Neon branches** per PR (different names), or race conditions about which URL your app/CI uses.  
- **Env scoping mismatch** → Vercel’s integration sets `DATABASE_URL` **in Vercel**, not in GitHub Actions. Your Drizzle step in Actions won’t see that unless you explicitly pass a URL into the job. citeturn0search7  
- **Conflicting envs in Vercel** if you had old DB variables when installing the integration. citeturn0search3

## What I recommend (pick one model)

### Model A — **Vercel-managed** preview DBs (simplest for runtime)
- Keep the **Vercel↔Neon integration** on; let it create one Neon branch per preview and inject `DATABASE_URL` for the running preview. citeturn0search11turn0search6  
- In **GitHub Actions**, do **not** create branches. Instead, if you must run schema checks in CI, fetch or construct the same branch name the integration uses (e.g., `preview-pr-<number>`) and connect to it via Neon API, or run Drizzle against a separate CI DB. citeturn0search6

### Model B — **Actions-managed** preview DBs (best if CI owns migrations)
- Turn **off** the Vercel integration.  
- Use Neon’s **GitHub Actions** to create/delete per-PR branches and pass `DATABASE_URL` from the action outputs into your Drizzle/test steps. Then set the **Vercel preview env** to that same URL as part of your deployment step. (Neon’s guides and samples show this exact pattern.) citeturn0search2turn0search4turn0search5

Either way avoids interference. What you **shouldn’t** do is keep both creating branches with **different naming conventions**.

## If you insist on running both
Make them converge:

1) **Standardize the branch name** (e.g., `preview-pr-<pr-number>`) and configure your Actions workflow to use that exact name; the Neon action will return the existing branch if Vercel already created it. citeturn0search6turn0search1  
2) **Pass `DATABASE_URL` explicitly** into CI steps (Drizzle/tests). Do not assume Vercel’s env bleeds into Actions. citeturn0search7

## Quick checklist to stop the current failure mode
- Decide A or B above and **disable the other** creator.  
- If B: in your GH Action running Drizzle, set  
  `env: { DATABASE_URL: ${{ steps.create.outputs.db_url }} }` (or whatever output you named). citeturn0search2  
- If A: remove branch creation in Actions; ensure your app uses Vercel-injected `DATABASE_URL` and your CI either targets that same branch name or uses a dedicated CI DB. citeturn0search11turn0search6

Net: Vercel’s Neon integration and GitHub Actions don’t fight at the API level; they just **both try to help**. Make one the boss and the other a consumer, and the “interference” disappears.


So we are using the github action and we're doing like drizzle checks and stuff and we have the github action creating branches and deleting branches. My main concern is that they interact nicely production and preview branches don't get fucked up and then my second concern is we only get 10 branches on the free plan which we're going to stay on until launch probably and my concern is that the versal branches don't get deleted they only get created so it seems to me while the github branches get deleted by the action therefore we quickly end up hitting that limit and then I have to manually go in and start deleting branches.


Mr. White — you’re right to be worried. Two things are happening:

1) **You’re using GitHub Actions to create & delete PR branches** (good).  
2) **Vercel’s Neon integration can *also* create preview branches** — but it **doesn’t clean them up** for you. Over time those pile up and hit the **branch quota** on your plan. citeturn0search6turn0search15

Neon confirms: the integration “creates an isolated database branch for each preview,” and docs explicitly tell you to **delete unused branches** via Console/CLI/API to avoid hitting branch limits. citeturn0search1turn0search6

Also, Neon’s free/entry plans only allow a small number of branches (e.g., plan examples reference **10 branches**; extra branches are billed on paid tiers). So if Vercel keeps creating and your GH Action deletes only its own, you’ll hit the cap fast. citeturn0search5turn0search0

# What to do (simple, safe, and cheap)

## Option A (recommended): **Make GitHub Actions the single owner** of DB branches
- **Turn off** the Vercel↔Neon preview-branch creation so you don’t get a second, unmanaged set of branches. (Keep Vercel DNS & deploys—just stop the Neon “one branch per preview” part.) Docs show that integration creates one branch per preview and that you must prune them; we’ll avoid this by not letting it create them. citeturn0search6
- Keep your current **create-branch** / **delete-branch** actions; they’re idempotent and reliable. If a branch name already exists, the action just returns it. citeturn0search2
- If you ever need manual cleanup, the official **delete-branch** action and API are there. Deleting a branch is permanent and removes its DB/roles/compute; never point this at `production` or `preview`. citeturn0search3turn0search13

## Option B (if you must keep the Vercel integration): **Converge & clean up**
- **Standardize the branch name** (e.g., `preview-pr-<number>`) so your GH Action finds/returns the same branch Vercel created (no duplicates). The action returns an existing branch when names match. citeturn0search2
- Add a **nightly cleanup** job that calls the **Neon API** to list branches and delete any `preview-pr-*` branches whose PR is closed. (Use `DELETE /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}`.) citeturn0search4turn0search8

# Guardrails that prevent “production/preview getting messed up”

- **Never target or delete long-lived branches.** In every workflow, hard-code a denylist: `production`, `preview`. The Neon docs note deletion is permanent (and you can’t delete a parent that has children). citeturn0search13
- **Use parent/child we set earlier:** `production` (root) → `preview` (child, reset to parent post-promotion) → `preview-pr-<n>` (children of `preview`). That keeps your main environments safe and consistent.
- **Enforce naming** in the workflow: only allow create/delete for names that match `^preview-pr-\d+$`. Everything else aborts.

# Staying under the 10-branch cap (without paying)

- **One PR → one branch; delete on close** (you already do this via the delete action). citeturn0search3
- **Block orphan creators.** If Vercel integration is off, you won’t get surprise extra branches. If on, add the nightly **API cleanup** (below).
- **Refuse to create the 11th**: a small step before your “create branch” that **counts branches via the Neon API** and fails with a friendly message when count ≥ 9 (leaving 1 slot for `preview`). citeturn0search8
- **Recycle (advanced)**: if you regularly have >10 open PRs, switch to a small **pool** (e.g., 6 rotating branches) and use Neon’s **reset-branch** to rebase an idle pool branch to `preview` and assign it to a new PR. (Reset action exists; this keeps total branch count low.) citeturn0search7

# Cut-and-paste cleanup job (nightly)
Use this if you keep the Vercel integration **or** want a belt-and-suspenders cleanup:

- List branches with the Neon API, filter names like `preview-pr-*`.  
- Cross-check against **open PRs** targeting `preview`.  
- **Delete** any `preview-pr-*` with no matching open PR (and never `preview`/`production`).  
Neon docs show the delete endpoint; your earlier cron idea aligns with their guidance to programmatically clean up preview branches. citeturn0search4turn0search6

# TL;DR
- Vercel’s Neon integration **creates** branches but doesn’t auto-delete → you hit free plan limits. citeturn0search6  
- Pick **one** owner of DB branches (recommend **GitHub Actions**).  
- Protect `production` & `preview` with denylist + naming checks. citeturn0search13  
- Add a **nightly API cleanup** or **turn off** the integration to avoid duplicates. citeturn0search6turn0search4

If you want, I’ll drop in the exact YAML for (1) a pre-create “branch count guard,” and (2) the nightly Neon-API cleanup, wired to your `NEON_PROJECT_ID` and `NEON_API_KEY`.


Okay, I'm just going to kill the versal integration. My only concern here is, do I have to worry about the environmental variables on Versal being set?


Yes — when you remove the Neon integration from Vercel, the environment variables that were injected by that integration will **also be removed**. The integration dynamically sets variables like `DATABASE_URL`, `PGHOST`, `PGDATABASE`, and so on per deployment environment. Removing the integration removes these. citeturn0search4

---

###  What Happens When You Kill the Vercel-Neon Integration

- In the **Neon console**: removing the integration only stops future branches from being created. Existing Neon branches (databases) remain until you delete them manually or by API. citeturn0search2turn0search4  
- In **Vercel**: the integration-managed environment variables are removed from your project’s Settings → Environment Variables. They’re not visible in the environment variable list before because they’re only injected at deployment time. Once the integration is disconnected, they disappear completely. citeturn0search2turn0search4

---

###  What You Should Do Next

1. **After removing the integration**, go to Vercel dashboard → your project → **Settings → Environment Variables**:
   - Confirm that variables like `DATABASE_URL`, `PGHOST`, etc., are gone.
2. **Re-add your own env vars manually**, using values from GitHub Action outputs or GitHub secrets:
   - Production deployments: set your production DB URL.
   - Preview deployments: either use a placeholder or leave blank (your GitHub Action should inject the correct URL per preview).
3. **Use Vercel CLI for verification:**  
   ```bash
   vercel env ls
   ```
   or  
   ```bash
   vercel env pull
   ```
   to confirm the current environment variables. citeturn0search18turn0search3

---

###  Summary

| Concern | Answer |
|---------|--------|
|Will env vars from the Vercel-Neon integration persist after removal?|**No.** They will be removed from Vercel project settings. citeturn0search4|
|Do I need to manually re-add necessary DB environment variables?|**Yes.** You must add them yourself via Vercel’s settings or CLI. citeturn0search3turn0search18|

---

Let me know if you’d like help structuring those env vars in Vercel settings or updating your GitHub Actions to pass the necessary `DATABASE_URL` into preview deployments.


Confused. If GitHub spins up a new branch, then there's going to be constantly changing environmental variables. How does Vercel then get those, right? Because the NEON branch is outputting those environmental variables, and then we're setting them for the drizzle check and stuff on GitHub Actions. But how does that get to Vercel then? Because I think right now, with the integration, it's automatically doing all that stuff. But if I kill the integration, don't I lose the auto-generated environmental variables for each push? And then what happens? Thank you.


Mr. White — you’ve got it: once you remove the Vercel↔Neon integration, Vercel will no longer auto-inject a `DATABASE_URL` for each preview. You have two clean ways to pass the per-PR Neon URL from GitHub Actions into each Vercel preview deploy.

# Option A (fastest): pass env straight to the **deployment**
Have your GH Action that creates the Neon branch take the emitted URL and hand it to Vercel **for that deployment only** via the CLI flags:

- **Build-time vars:** `vercel --build-env KEY=VALUE …`  
- **Runtime vars:** `vercel --env KEY=VALUE …`  citeturn0search13

So your deploy step becomes (illustrative):

```bash
vercel deploy --prebuilt \
  --token $VERCEL_TOKEN \
  --env DATABASE_URL=${NEON_DB_URL_WITH_POOLER}
```

This sets `DATABASE_URL` on that deployment without modifying project settings. (The CLI’s `--env`/`--build-env` is the official way to inject per-deployment variables.) citeturn0search13

# Option B (stickier): **upsert** a branch-scoped Preview var, then deploy
If you prefer the variable to live in Vercel’s Project settings (so reruns/redeploys for that branch pick it up automatically), write it via the Vercel **Projects Env Vars API** with target `preview` and the **specific Git branch**; then trigger the deploy:

1) POST `/v10/projects/{idOrName}/env?upsert=true` with:
```json
{
  "key": "DATABASE_URL",
  "value": "<neon db url>",
  "type": "encrypted",
  "target": ["preview"],
  "gitBranch": "<branch-name>"
}
```
2) Kick your `vercel deploy`.

## Wiring it end-to-end (recommended pattern)

1) **Create Neon PR branch** in GH Actions → capture outputs:
   - `db_url` (non-pooler for migrations), `db_url_with_pooler` (runtime) citeturn0search3
2) **Run Drizzle check/migrations** in CI using `db_url`. (As you already do.)
3) **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - **Option A:** `vercel deploy … --env DATABASE_URL=${{ steps.create.outputs.db_url_with_pooler }}`  
   - **Option B:** call the **Vercel Env API** to upsert `DATABASE_URL` for `target=preview` + this PR branch, then `vercel deploy`. citeturn0search13turn0search4turn0search2

Notes:
- Vercel’s Preview environment applies to *any branch that is not your Production Branch*; you can also **bind env vars to a specific branch** so only that preview gets the value. citeturn0search5turn0search2turn0search11
- If you ever need to inspect the envs, `vercel env ls` / `vercel env pull` shows what’s set in the project. citeturn0search0turn0search10

---

## Which should you choose?
- **Use Option A** if you want zero residue in project settings and a dead-simple pipeline (most YC-style minimal).  
- **Use Option B** if you like branch-sticky envs that persist across rebuilds for that branch.

Either way, nothing breaks when you kill the integration—you just **become the one** handing Vercel the DB URL per preview via your workflow.

If you want, I’ll drop the exact YAML snippets for both paths (CLI flags vs API upsert) into your current workflow.


Alright, we're gonna go with option A.


Got it, Mr. White—Option A it is. Here’s the lean, YC-style way to wire it so every preview deploy gets the right Neon URL without the Vercel↔Neon integration.

# What we’ll do
- GH Actions creates the Neon PR branch → emits `db_url` (non-pooler) + `db_url_pooled` (runtime).
- We run Drizzle against `db_url`.
- We deploy to Vercel **and pass** `DATABASE_URL` **for that deployment only** using the CLI’s `--env` flag. No project-wide env churn. citeturn0search7turn0search17

# Minimal workflow snippet (drop-in)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/preview-deploy.yml
name: Preview Deploy
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]
jobs:
  neon_create_and_check:
    if: github.event.pull_request.base.ref == 'preview' && github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork == false
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      DB_URL: ${{ steps.neon.outputs.db_url }}
      DB_URL_POOLED: ${{ steps.neon.outputs.db_url_pooled }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Create Neon PR branch (parent = preview)
        id: neon
        uses: neondatabase/create-branch-action@v5
        with:
          project_id: ${{ vars.NEON_PROJECT_ID }}
          branch_name: preview-pr-${{ github.event.number }}
          parent: preview
          api_key: ${{ secrets.NEON_API_KEY }}

      - name: Drizzle check (schema, non-pooler URL)
        run: pnpm drizzle:check
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ steps.neon.outputs.db_url }}

  vercel_deploy:
    needs: neon_create_and_check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build locally (fast)
        run: |
          pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
          pnpm build

      - name: Deploy preview (inject DATABASE_URL for this deploy only)
        run: |
          npx vercel deploy --prebuilt \
            --token "$VERCEL_TOKEN" \
            --env DATABASE_URL=${{ needs.neon_create_and_check.outputs.DB_URL_POOLED }}
        env:
          VERCEL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

**Why this works**
- `vercel deploy --env KEY=VALUE` sets env **on that deployment** (and `--build-env` for build-time if you need it). You’re not editing project settings; you’re just handing the runtime secret to that one preview. citeturn0search17turn0search13
- Preview deployments are created whenever you deploy without `--prod`; that’s what the snippet does. citeturn0search4turn0search9
- The Neon action’s outputs are the canonical source: `db_url` (schema ops), `db_url_pooled` (app runtime). citeturn0search7

# Small guards you’ll want
- **Masking:** never echo the URL. If you must confirm presence, print a masked check (e.g., `${DATABASE_URL:0:8}****`).
- **Forks:** keep `fork == false` as shown—secrets don’t flow to forks. citeturn0search3
- **Cleanup:** keep your existing “delete Neon branch on PR close” workflow to stay under the 10-branch cap.
- **Optional:** if you rebundle on Vercel (not using `--prebuilt`), pass build-time vars with `--build-env` similarly. citeturn0search17

If you want, I can also add the **delete on close** job (you have it) and a tiny **nightly safety cleanup** against orphan `preview-pr-*` branches to ensure you never hit the Neon free-plan limit.


The NEON project was created through the Versa marketplace per your recommendation. If I kill the integration, won't that just delete the whole NEON installation?


Mr. White—disabling the Vercel ↔ Neon integration does **not** delete your Neon project, **but it does stop the environment variables** from being injected into Vercel deployments.

---

###  What Actually Happens When You Kill the Integration

####  Neon project stays intact
- Your Neon database remains untouched.
- Deleting the integration **does not delete the underlying database or project**. That only happens via a **manual deletion of the database** from the Vercel dashboard’s Storage settings. citeturn0search1

####  Environment variables are removed from Vercel
- You’ll lose automatically injected variables like `DATABASE_URL`, `PGHOST`, `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`, etc., which are provisioned per deployment when the integration is active. citeturn0search1turn0search4
- Vercel’s project dashboard will no longer show these vars, since they were only injected at deployment time by the integration.

###  Summary Table

| Concern                                 | Outcome After Killing Integration                         |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Neon project deletion                   | ❌ Not deleted unless you manually delete it in Vercel    |
| Environment variable injection to Vercel |  Removed — must handle manually in your deployment flow  |

---

###  What to Do Next (Option A flow)

Since you’re using GitHub Actions to manage PR deployments, you’ll need to **explicitly pass Neon’s DATABASE_URL** during deployment—something we’ve already architected.

Continuing with your workflow:
1. **Create Neon branch & capture URL** → Drizzle checks
2. **Deploy to Vercel with CLI using `--env`**, injecting `DATABASE_URL` just for that preview deploy. No reliance on the integration anymore.

Let me know if you'd like assistance crafting the `vercel deploy --env` command in your workflow or testing that flow so WR work it smoothly without the integration.

---

Would you like me to draft the proper Vercel CLI deploy snippet for your GH Actions pipeline to handle this?


Well, I uninstalled the integration and deleted the whole project.
