**Higgsfield API – Summary (Developer Context)**

- **Platform**: Higgsfield is a generative AI platform for creating cinematic-style videos, animations, and images via web UI and integrated models like *Sora 2* and other motion/VFX tools. citeturn0search1turn0search2

- **Official API Availability**: There is *no widely documented public API released by Higgsfield* for programmatic access at the time of this writing. Many sources and community posts indicate developers cannot officially call a Higgsfield API the same way you would with a typical REST service and there’s no standard published documentation accessible publicly. citeturn0search3

- **SDK Presence**: GitHub shows a *higgsfield-client* Python SDK repository, suggesting there *may be an API client or internal API surface* used by that SDK, but it’s not widely documented with stable, public REST endpoints or official API docs linked from Higgsfield’s main site. citeturn0search4

- **Unofficial / Third-Party Docs**: Scraps of Higgsfield API documentation (e.g., endpoints like `POST /v1/generate` with parameters for text-to-video, image-to-video, etc.) circulate on the web in PDF or unofficial docs. These aren’t confirmed official sources, so their correctness can vary. citeturn0search12

- **Integration Guidance**: Community and integration guides (e.g., n8n posts) assume HTTP requests to an API directly, implying standard REST + API key authentication, but the exact endpoint format is only available in snippets or inferred from third-party guides rather than official Higgsfield published docs. citeturn0search9

- **Alternative for Developers**: Because Higgsfield’s own API isn’t fully exposed for developers, some developers use alternative APIs (e.g., Muapi.ai) that offer programmatic access to similar cinematic video and effects generation. citeturn0search3

**Practical Notes for Integration**
1. **Account & API Key**: You typically must create a Higgsfield account and generate API credentials from the dashboard (if available). citeturn0search10  
2. **HTTP/REST**: API calls (where available) use HTTP with an API key in headers for authentication and JSON bodies for requests. citeturn0search12  
3. **Endpoints (Unofficial)**: Typical generation endpoints include text-to-video (`POST /v1/generate`) with fields like `prompt`, `image_url`, `duration`, and `resolution`. citeturn0search12  
4. **Community Integration**: In workflow automation tools (e.g., n8n), you configure an HTTP request node pointing at Higgsfield API URLs with the key and payload defined manually. citeturn0search9

**Conclusion**

An official, documented **Higgsfield API for developers is not openly published** in a stable public form at this time. You can explore internal or client SDKs (like the Python client on GitHub) and unofficial docs that describe generator endpoints, but they may not be supported for production use. Alternative API-centric services replicate similar video and cinematic effect capabilities for integration. citeturn0search3
