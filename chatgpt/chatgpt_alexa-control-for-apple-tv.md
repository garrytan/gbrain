## User

Yo dawg, is there an Alexa skill for Apple TV if I wanted to use my Echo or Echo Show to control my Apple TV? How can I do that?

---

## Assistant

There’s **no official Alexa skill** that lets Echo devices natively control Apple TV directly. Apple hasn’t released any integration with Alexa, so things like turning it on/off, launching apps, navigating menus, etc. are all unavailable out of the box citeturn0search3turn0search13.

That said, you can still get **limited voice control** using one of two workarounds:

---

### 🚪 Option 1: Bluetooth Audio Only  
You can pair your Echo via Bluetooth to your Apple TV:
1. On Apple TV: go to *Settings > Remotes & Devices > Bluetooth*.
2. Put your Echo into pairing mode (“Alexa, pair”).
3. Connect.  
This lets Alexa act as your Apple TV’s speaker, and you can say things like “Alexa, pause” or “Alexa, play.” **No menu navigation or app launching** is supported this way citeturn0search0turn0search3.

### 🔧 Option 2: Smart‑Home Hub (e.g., Homebridge or Harmony Hub)

#### A. **Homebridge + Alexa Plugin**
Tech-savvy users can run a **Homebridge server** with Apple TV and Alexa plugins. This effectively exposes your Apple TV to Alexa via HomeKit, enabling commands like “Alexa, pause Apple TV” or “Alexa, turn on Apple TV.” It requires:
- Apple TV 4K (tvOS 17+)
- A Home Hub (HomePod or Apple TV in HomeKit)
- Homebridge server with proper plugins citeturn0search3turn0search2  

#### B. **Infrared Hub (e.g., Logitech Harmony)**
Use a universal remote hub to bridge commands:
1. Connect Harmony Hub and pair it with your Apple TV (IR-based).
2. Link Harmony skill in Alexa.
3. Use voice commands such as “Alexa, turn on Apple TV” or “Alexa, pause Apple TV” citeturn0search0turn0search3.

### TL;DR Summary

| Method                    | Works for...                         | Requires                                             |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bluetooth**             | Play/Pause, Volume                   | Echo in pairing mode                                |
| **Homebridge + Alexa**    | Play/Pause, On/Off, Basic playback   | Apple TV 4K, HomeHub, Node server & plugins         |
| **Harmony (IR hub)**      | Power, Playback, Volume              | Harmony Hub & Alexa skill                          |

So, Mr. White — if you want **full Alexa control**, you're looking at setting up Homebridge or a Harmony Hub. If you're fine with **just audio control**, Bluetooth is the simplest.

Need step‑by‑step for one of these setups?
