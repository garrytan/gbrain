## Assistant

**Spotify API (Spotify Web API)** allows developers to access Spotify’s music catalog and user data and integrate it into applications. It exposes REST endpoints that return JSON data about artists, albums, tracks, playlists, and user activity. citeturn0search3turn0search19  

Official documentation:  
- link_titleSpotify Web API Documentationturn0search0

## Core Capabilities
Using the API, applications can:

- Search Spotify’s catalog (artists, albums, tracks)
- Retrieve metadata about music
- Access user profiles and libraries
- Create or modify playlists
- Control playback on user devices
- Get audio features and analysis for tracks citeturn0search19turn0search28  

Example endpoint:
```
GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=artist:taylor%20swift&type=artist
```

Base API URL:
```
https://api.spotify.com/v1
``` citeturn0search3

---

## Authentication (OAuth 2.0)
Every request requires an **access token** obtained through Spotify’s authorization service. citeturn0search12  

Common flows:

1. **Authorization Code Flow**
   - Used when accessing user data
   - User logs into Spotify and grants permission
   - App receives authorization code → exchanges for access token

2. **Client Credentials Flow**
   - For server-to-server requests (no user data)
   - Requires `client_id` and `client_secret` citeturn0search6turn0search8  

Example token request:
```
POST https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token

grant_type=client_credentials
```

The returned **access token** is included in requests:
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

---

## Example API Call
Get artist information:

```
GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/{id}
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

Response includes:
- name
- genres
- popularity
- followers
- images

---

## SDKs and Tools
Spotify also provides additional developer tools:

- **Web Playback SDK** – stream Spotify tracks directly inside a web app. citeturn0search18  
- **iOS / Android SDKs** – integrate Spotify playback in mobile apps. citeturn0search1  

---

## Typical Use Cases
- Music discovery apps  
- Playlist generators  
- Listening analytics dashboards  
- “Now playing” widgets  
- Recommendation engines  

---

If needed, specify the goal (e.g., **build a playlist tool, scrape listening data, recommendation engine, or startup idea**) and a stack (Node, Python, etc.). A minimal working Spotify API example can be provided.
