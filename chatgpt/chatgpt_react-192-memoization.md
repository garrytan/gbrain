## User

Yo, with the addition of auto-memorization in React 19.2, is memoing anything even relevant?

Mr. White — *if* you mean React’s new **automatic memoization**, that’s the **React Compiler**, not a runtime behavior that ships “on” just because you upgraded to React 19.2. React 19.2 is a React release; the Compiler is an **optional build-time step** you enable in your toolchain. citeturn1view0turn1view1

So: **memoing is still relevant**, but **where** depends on whether the Compiler is enabled.

### If you are **NOT** using React Compiler
Nothing fundamental changes: `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` are still the same tools for avoiding wasted renders / expensive recompute / unstable identities.

### If you **ARE** using React Compiler
Most manual memoization becomes unnecessary because the compiler “automatically applies the equivalent of `memo`” and can often do *more precise* memoization than humans. citeturn1view2turn1view1

But memoing is still relevant as an **escape hatch** in a few common situations:

- **You need stable identity for semantics, not speed**  
  Example: keeping an effect from re-firing because a dependency is referentially unstable. React explicitly calls out `useMemo`/`useCallback` for this. citeturn1view1

- **Interop with third-party libs that depend on referential equality**  
  (Charts, editors, virtualization, subscriptions, imperative APIs, etc.) The compiler can’t always “see” what those libraries require; you sometimes still pin identities manually.

- **Code the compiler can’t or won’t optimize**  
  Impure components, unsupported patterns, or code outside compiled boundaries reduce what it can safely memoize. (You’ll see this via compiler/lint feedback.) citeturn1view1

- **Custom equality logic**  
  If you *intentionally* want a specific `arePropsEqual` behavior, that’s still a `React.memo`-shaped decision. (Most apps don’t need this.)

### Practical rule
- **With the Compiler on:** default to **no manual memo**; add `useMemo`/`useCallback` only when you can point to a real behavior/perf issue (usually effect deps or library interop). citeturn1view1turn1view2  
- **Without it:** memo tools are still part of normal performance hygiene.

If you tell me your stack (Next/Vite/Expo/etc.) I can tell you what “Compiler on” actually looks like in that setup and what to watch for.
