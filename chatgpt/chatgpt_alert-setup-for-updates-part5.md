Mr. White —

**Auto‑Claude new release check (Automation Turn 2):**  

I found the **Releases** page for **AndyMik90/Auto‑Claude** on GitHub, and as of this check there *was a recent “Releases” entry shown (~16 h ago)* on that page, indicating **activity in the releases section**. citeturn0search4  

However, there is **no detailed listing of a new release version** or changelog entries available via the page content I could fetch — so at this moment **no clearly identifiable new version (e.g., 2.7.3 or similar) was parseable**.  

**Status:** *No new explicit release version detected beyond what was previously known.*  

I will continue to notify you on the next scheduled automation run if a new release is clearly published.


Mr. White —  

The **latest Windsurf changelog** shows a **new release (Wave 13: Merry Shipmas)** that *includes a new model and promo access*:  

**• SWE‑1.5 Free model** — Windsurf’s near‑frontier SWE‑1.5 model is now **available to all users for free for the next 3 months**, with the **same core intelligence as SWE‑1.5** but delivered at standard throughput speeds; it **replaces SWE‑1 as the default model** in Windsurf. citeturn0search2  

Other significant additions in this release (not model‑related but workflow relevant):  
• Parallel, multi‑agent sessions support (Git worktrees) citeturn0search2  
• Multi‑Cascade panes & tabs citeturn0search2  
• Dedicated Cascade terminal (beta) citeturn0search2  

**Summary:** A **new model introduced with promotional free access (SWE‑1.5 Free)** is present in the most recent changelog update. citeturn0search2


Mr. White — Automation Turn 2 complete. Here’s what I found as of **Jan 5 2026** for materially significant updates to **Cursor, Claude Code, and OpenAI Codex** (models, agent workflows, work trees/cloud agents, etc.):

---

### **Cursor**
**Recent changelog updates:**
- Cursor added **conversation insights** that analyze agent work type, complexity, and context across sessions — useful for understanding agent behavior in coding tasks. citeturn1search0
- Shared **agent transcripts** can now be generated and forked for team reuse and documentation. citeturn1search0

**Platform evolution:**
- Cursor supports **parallel agents / worktrees**, enabling simultaneous agent runs and multi‑model prompting. citeturn1search5

**Material significance:**  
No *new major release* (version jump) detected this cycle, but **new agent analytics and transcript sharing features** plus **parallel agents/worktree support** are meaningful workflow enhancements.

---

### **Claude Code**
**Recent release activity:**  
- Community reports indicate a **Claude Code CLI release (v2.0.73)** with minor quality‑of‑life enhancements (e.g., clickable image links, history navigation, search filtering). citeturn1search18

**Changelog context:**  
- Claude Code has frequent iterative updates, but nothing in this automation cycle rises to the level of a *major architectural change* like cloud agents or worktree primitives per se. citeturn1search9

**Material significance:**  
Routine CLI updates with incremental UX improvements — **no new major model or cloud capability** surfaced in this turn.

---

### **OpenAI Codex**
**Changelog and features:**
- **Agent skills support** was added to Codex (CLI and IDE extensions), introducing reusable skill bundles that help Codex complete tasks more reliably and modularly. citeturn1search3
- Latest published notes show a **Codex CLI release (0.77.0)** with agent skills, among recent staged versions. citeturn1search15

**Material significance:**  
The **agent skills feature** qualifies as a substantial enhancement to Codex’s agentic capabilities in both terminal and editor contexts.

---

### **Summary of Material Changes This Cycle**
**✔ Cursor** — New agent insights and shared transcripts; worktree/parallel agent support continues to mature.  
**✔ Claude Code** — Incremental CLI release (v2.0.73); improvements in UX but no major new paradigm.  
**✔ Codex** — Added **agent skills** support in CLI/IDE workflows — a functionally meaningful expansion of Codex’s agent tooling.  

No new *major model launches* (e.g., entirely new ML models) were detected across these platforms in this automation turn.

**Automation Turn #2 – Major updates check (Cursor, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex)**

**1) OpenAI Codex — *Major model release detected***  
- **GPT‑5‑Codex** has been officially rolled out — a specialized version of GPT‑5 tuned for coding that features *dynamic reasoning time* (scales from seconds up to ~7 hours on complex coding tasks). This represents a **material upgrade** from prior Codex capabilities and is positioned as a flagship coding agent. citeturn0news1

**2) Cursor — *Ongoing platform evolution***  
- Cursor recently integrated its **proprietary Composer model** and expanded agent execution capabilities (parallel agents). While this was earlier reported when Cursor 2.0 launched, there are *follow‑ups* noting internal agent harness updates for supporting newer Codex models (e.g., GPT‑5.1‑Codex‑Max) — this is more of an *integration optimization* than a distinct new user‑facing release. citeturn0news0turn0search11

**3) Claude Code — *No standalone major release detected this cycle***  
- Claude Code continues rising in usage and adoption, but there’s **no distinct new version or major platform release** (e.g., Claude Code v2 with cloud agents/worktrees) publicly noted in this automation period. Coverage emphasizes ecosystem traction rather than a documented release. citeturn0news28

**Summary of materially significant changes this run**
