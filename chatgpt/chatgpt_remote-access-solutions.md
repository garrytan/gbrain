## User

I used to use screen connect to log into 20+ computers around the world from my phone.

What’s a similar solution that’s modern I can use to log into my laptop at home from my phone for doing things like remotely pushing code that I forgot to commit or checking progress on ai coding agents running on the machine.

## Assistant

Mr. White, for your use case (quickly hop in from your phone to your home laptop to push code / check agent runs), there are two “modern” patterns:

1) **GUI remote desktop (like ScreenConnect)**
2) **VPN + SSH/terminal-first access (better for dev chores)**

Here are solid 2025 options in both buckets, with what I’d pick and why.

---

## Best “modern ScreenConnect-like” GUI options

### **Chrome Remote Desktop (free, dead simple)**
- Works on Windows/macOS/Linux and iOS/Android.
- Great when you just need to open a full desktop from a phone with minimal fuss.  
- Security is PIN + encrypted channel, good enough for personal use. citeturn0news35turn0search6turn0news41

**Why you’d like it:** basically zero config, no port forwarding, stable mobile apps.

**Setup (5 min):**
1. On laptop: install Chrome + Chrome Remote Desktop, enable “Remote Access.”
2. Set a strong PIN + keep the machine awake on AC.
3. On phone: install CRD app, tap your laptop.

---

### **RustDesk (open-source, self-hostable, more “you own it”)**
- Cross-platform, end-to-end encrypted, TeamViewer/AnyDesk style UX. citeturn0search1turn0search13turn0news41  
- You can use their public relay or self-host a relay for max control/privacy. citeturn0search9turn0search21

**Why you’d like it:** feels like a modern OSS ScreenConnect; no “free-tier commercial use” drama.

**Setup (quick path):**
1. Install RustDesk on laptop + phone.
2. Pair using ID/password or set unattended access.
3. Optional later: self-host relay if you want full control.

### Other strong paid GUI tools
If you want a polished commercial experience:
- **Splashtop** (fast, good mobile UX) citeturn0news35turn0search14  
- **AnyDesk / TeamViewer** (ubiquitous, but TeamViewer can flag “commercial use” even for heavy personal dev) citeturn0news35turn0search14turn0news41

## Best dev-centric option: **Tailscale + SSH**
This is the move if your main tasks are git, checking logs, kicking agents, etc.

- Tailscale creates a private WireGuard mesh between your phone and laptop without opening ports on your router. citeturn0search15
- With **Tailscale SSH**, you can SSH directly to your laptop over that private network, with Tailscale handling auth + encryption. citeturn0search0turn0search2

**Why you’d like it:**  
- No port forwarding, no exposing SSH to the internet.  
- Super reliable from anywhere.  
- Terminal on a phone is *way* faster for “forgot to commit” moments than tapping around a GUI.

**How to set it up (practical path):**
1. Install Tailscale on laptop + phone, log into same tailnet. citeturn0search15  
2. Enable Tailscale SSH on the laptop (admin console or config). citeturn0search0turn0search23  
3. On phone, use an SSH client like **Termius** (or your favorite). Termius + Tailscale is a common combo. citeturn0search19  
4. SSH to your laptop’s Tailscale IP/hostname.

**What this gets you:**
- `git status && git commit && git push`
- `tail -f` on agent logs
- restarting jobs, checking disk, etc., from a tiny screen without pain.

---

## My recommendation for you
**Do both:**
- **Primary:** **Tailscale + SSH** for 90% of dev/agent checking.  
- **Fallback GUI:** **Chrome Remote Desktop** if you need to open a browser, IDE UI, or poke something visual.

That combo is modern, secure, low-maintenance, and phone-friendly.

If you want, tell me your laptop OS (macOS/Windows/Linux) and whether you’re comfy with SSH keys vs passwords, and I’ll give you a tight, OS-specific setup checklist.

## User

Is there an iOS app for the chrome Remote Desktop solution?

---

## Assistant

Mr. White, not anymore in the “native app” sense.

Google **deprecated and stopped supporting the Chrome Remote Desktop iOS app around Sept 2025**, and it’s no longer in the App Store. If you still have it installed, it may limp along, but you can’t reliably reinstall or expect updates. citeturn0search0turn0search7

**What you can use on iOS instead:**
- Open Safari/Chrome on your iPhone and go to the **Chrome Remote Desktop web app** at remotedesktop.google.com, then sign in and connect that way. Google’s own help page now points iOS users to mobile/web access. citeturn0search1turn0search3

If you want a **modern native iOS remote-desktop app**, the closest replacements are:
- **RustDesk** (best OSS ScreenConnect vibe)
- **Splashtop** (best polished paid mobile UX)

Happy to recommend between those two based on your laptop OS + whether you want self-hosted or simplest-possible.
