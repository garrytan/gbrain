Here’s what I found about **entity["software", "GPT-5.1-Codex-Max", 0]** (sometimes stylised “Codex Max”):

---

### ✅ What it is  
- Codex Max is an advanced coding‐agent model from entity["organization", "OpenAI", 0], built for long-horizon, large‐scale software engineering tasks. citeturn0search0turn0search6turn0search4  
- It’s an evolution of the earlier entity["software", "GPT-5.1-Codex", 0] model, replacing it in the “Codex” product surfaces. citeturn0search0turn0search6  
- Key feature: the model supports “compaction” — i.e., when its context window is reaching its limit, it prunes or refreshes its context while retaining important state so it can work coherently over many millions of tokens (i.e., across hours/long development sessions). citeturn0search0turn0search4  
- It is trained on real‐world engineering use: pull‐requests, code reviews, front-end engineering, Q&A, full stack tasks. citeturn0search0  
- It is claimed to offer performance and token‐efficiency improvements: e.g., on an internal “SWE-Bench” benchmark it outperformed GPT-5.1-Codex (prior) with fewer tokens. citeturn0search0  

---

### 🧰 Use & availability  
- Codex Max is available now in the Codex product surfaces (CLI, IDE extension, cloud) for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, Enterprise plans. citeturn0search0  
- Soon (or “coming”) in an API form. citeturn0search0turn0search4  
- The model is recommended *only* for “agentic coding tasks in Codex or Codex-like environments”, not for general chat or non-coding workflows. citeturn0search0  

---

### ⚠️ Limitations & considerations  
- Although more capable, the model still has security/cyber capabilities that are monitored; OpenAI notes that while it’s the “most capable cybersecurity model we’ve deployed to date”, it does *not* yet achieve “High capability” under their framework. citeturn0search0  
- For large codebases, modelling and memory are challenging; while compaction helps, there are still open questions about how well such models maintain large‐scale repository knowledge. citeturn0search4  
- Some developer commentary (e.g., Reddit threads) express caution about trusting fully autonomous long‐running agentic workflows (since the “partner” vs “independent agent” distinction is blurred). citeturn0search6turn0search1  

---

### 📌 Why it matters  
For developers or teams working on project‐scale codebases (thousands/millions of lines, many modules, long sessions) this kind of model offers potential to:  
- Save time in repetitive engineering tasks (linting, refactoring, review)  
- Enable deeper agentic workflows (e.g., multi-module refactors, persistent tasks over hours)  
- Work more cost-efficiently, since fewer tokens are needed per task  
However: manual oversight remains important.

If you like, Mr. White, I can dig up **detailed benchmark comparisons**, **pricing & plan details**, or **step-by-step setup instructions** for using Codex Max in your workflow. Would that be helpful?
