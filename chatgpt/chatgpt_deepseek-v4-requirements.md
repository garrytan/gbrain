deepseek v4 flash local requirements

---

## Assistant

Mr. White, I’ll verify whether “DeepSeek V4 Flash” is an official model name, then give practical local hardware requirements for the closest confirmed model by quantization, context length, and consumer feasibility.

---

## Assistant

Mr. White, **DeepSeek V4 Flash is real, but it is heavy for local use**: official specs list **284B total parameters, 13B active parameters, 1M-token context, FP4+FP8 mixed precision**. The active size is 13B, but the full model weights still have to be stored/served. citeturn191249view1turn642140view2

### Practical local requirements

| Setup | What you need | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| **Recommended local GPU server** | **2× H100 80GB** or **1× H200 141GB**, **256GB+ system RAM**, **300GB+ disk** | Best realistic self-hosting path for V4-Flash. RunPod’s guide gives this class of hardware for Flash. citeturn829164search7 |
| **Production vLLM-style serving** | **H100 / H200 / B200 / A100-class NVIDIA GPUs**, Linux, vLLM | NVIDIA lists Linux plus A100, H100, H200, and B200 support; vLLM is recommended for sparse-attention inference. citeturn642140view1 |
| **Single-GPU experiment** | **RTX PRO 6000 96GB** or **A100 80GB**, **128–256GB RAM**, **300GB disk** | Possible via community GGUF + modified `llama.cpp`, usually with CPU/system-memory offload. DataCamp’s working setup used RTX PRO 6000, 300GB volume disk, and a **146GB GGUF** file. citeturn965374view4 |
| **Apple Silicon / MLX** | Prefer **192GB unified memory** Mac; 1TB+ SSD | The MLX community checkpoint is listed at **155GB**, so 128GB unified memory is tight and likely swap-heavy. citeturn965374view5 |
| **Consumer GPU box** | 2×4090/5090 class can only do quantized/offloaded experiments | 24–48GB VRAM is far below the ~146–160GB model footprint, so expect slow CPU offload or use a smaller model. |
| **Ollama** | `deepseek-v4-flash:cloud` | Ollama’s listed model is a **cloud** tag, with size shown as “-”, so this is not a normal local Ollama pull/run model. citeturn228746view0 |

### Software requirements

Use **Linux + CUDA**, then either **vLLM**, **SGLang**, or a **modified `llama.cpp`** build. Stock local support is still immature: the current GGUF route depends on community conversions and a work-in-progress `llama.cpp` branch with DeepSeek V4 architecture, native FP8, and MXFP4 support. citeturn965374view4turn191249view3

### Bottom line

For a serious local install: **2× H100 80GB, 256GB RAM, 300GB+ fast SSD**.

For a workstation experiment: **RTX PRO 6000 96GB or A100 80GB, 128–256GB RAM, community GGUF, modified `llama.cpp`, 32K context to start**.

For a normal desktop: use **DeepSeek V4 Flash API/Ollama cloud**, or run a smaller local model.

nvidia nim deepseek vs openrouter cost

---

## Assistant

I’ll compare current listed pricing directly, then translate it into practical “one heavy hour” costs for a Chief-of-Staff / coding-agent workload.

---

## Assistant

Mr. White, **for pure cost: OpenRouter DeepSeek V4 Flash is the clean default. NVIDIA NIM only wins if you are using its free/trial endpoint or already have cheap GPUs.**

### Current token pricing

| Route | DeepSeek V4 Flash | DeepSeek V4 Pro | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **DeepSeek direct API** | **$0.14/M input, $0.28/M output** | **$0.435/M input, $0.87/M output** during current Pro discount | Direct official pricing. Cache-hit input for Flash is **$0.0028/M**, which is insanely cheap if cache works for repeated agent context. citeturn666592view1 |
| **OpenRouter** | **$0.14/M input, $0.28/M output** | **$0.435/M input, $0.87/M output** | Same visible pricing for Flash/Pro, with OpenRouter routing/fallback convenience. citeturn666592view2turn985172search9 |
| **NVIDIA NIM hosted API** | Public docs show **trial/free endpoint / NIM availability**, but I do **not** see clean public per-token pricing | Same issue | Good for testing. Production cost is unclear unless you have contracted NVIDIA pricing. NVIDIA describes hosted endpoints as a fast prototyping path and NIM as downloadable/self-hostable. citeturn917255search3turn666592view3 |
| **Self-host NIM** | GPU-hour cost | GPU-hour cost | Likely expensive unless highly utilized. RunPod H100 PCIe is listed from **$2.39/hr**, H200 from **$3.99/hr**. citeturn751504search5turn751504search3 |

### Example “heavy agent hour” costs

Assume one Chief-of-Staff / Hermes-style hour burns:

| Usage/hour | DeepSeek V4 Flash via OpenRouter/direct | DeepSeek V4 Pro via OpenRouter/direct |
|---|---:|---:|
| **500k input + 100k output** | **$0.098/hr** | **$0.3045/hr** |
| **1M input + 250k output** | **$0.21/hr** | **$0.6525/hr** |
| **3M input + 750k output** | **$0.63/hr** | **$1.9575/hr** |
| **10M input + 2M output** | **$1.96/hr** | **$6.09/hr** |

### Self-host break-even

If you rent **1× H100 at ~$2.39/hr**, OpenRouter/direct Flash is cheaper until you exceed roughly:

**~12M input + 3M output tokens/hour**  
Cost: `12M * $0.14 + 3M * $0.28 = $2.52/hr`

That assumes one H100 can actually serve your workload well, which may be tight for V4 Flash. For a more realistic **2× H100** setup, break-even is closer to **24M input + 6M output tokens/hour**.

### Recommendation for Jovie / Hermes

Use this routing:

1. **Default Chief-of-Staff model:** `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` on **OpenRouter**  
   Cheapest clean path, easy provider switching, no GPU ops.

2. **Escalation model:** `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` only for hard architecture, repo-wide planning, or debugging loops.

3. **Try NVIDIA NIM separately**, but treat it as experimental for Hermes right now. There are recent NVIDIA forum reports about DeepSeek V4 NIM tool-call streaming/token-count weirdness, which matters for agent workflows. citeturn917255search7turn985172search4

4. **Self-host NIM only after telemetry proves sustained load.** For your current agent orchestration, API pricing almost certainly beats GPU rental unless agents are running constantly at very high token volume.
