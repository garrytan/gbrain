Clerk Elements is no longer in development and will not receive any updates. We're actively building a replacement for Clerk Elements with a different approach to customization, and we'll share more details soon.

## Assistant

Mr. White — I looked for anything concrete on the “replacement” and, as of **Dec 18, 2025**, Clerk’s docs only say: **Elements is no longer in development, won’t receive updates, and they’ll share more details soon**. No public name, API, timeline, or migration guide yet. citeturn0search0turn0search2

What you should do now (practical plan):

### 1) Don’t panic: your current Elements UI should keep working
“Not receiving updates” ≠ “turned off.” It means increasing risk over time (new auth features, edge cases, or breaking platform changes won’t be handled). citeturn0search0

### 2) Pick your migration target (2 realistic options)
**Option A — Move to Clerk prebuilt components + Appearance**
Fastest, lowest maintenance. If you can live with the customization limits, use `<SignIn/>`, `<SignUp/>`, etc., and style via `appearance`. citeturn2search7turn2search1

**Option B — Rebuild on Clerk “Custom flows” (recommended if you needed Elements)**
This is Clerk’s actively-supported “build your own UI” path: use **`useSignIn()` / `useSignUp()`** and the **custom flow guides** (email links, OAuth, MFA flows, etc.). citeturn2search0turn2search10turn2search13turn2search3turn2search5  
This gives you maximum control, but you own more UI/state handling.

### 3) Triage checklist (so you don’t get surprised later)
- **Inventory what you used in Elements**: sign-in, sign-up, OTP, email links, OAuth, MFA, organizations, etc.
- **Decide “must-keep” UX** vs “nice-to-have”.
- If you have any **non-trivial flows** (MFA, email links, org selection), prototype them using **Custom flows** now.
- Add monitoring for auth errors + conversion (sign-in success, verification drop-off).

### 4) How to track the replacement
- Watch Clerk’s **changelog** and the Elements docs pages for an announcement. citeturn1search2turn0search0  
(So far, nothing public beyond the warning.)

If you paste (or summarize) **which Elements components/flows you implemented** (email+password, magic link, OAuth, MFA, orgs, etc.), I’ll tell you which of the two paths above is lowest-risk and outline the specific Clerk docs/pages you’ll map each screen to.
