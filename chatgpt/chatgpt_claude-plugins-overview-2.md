Here’s a concise overview of **Claude plugins** — what they are and how they’re being used (as of early 2026):

### What Claude Plugins Are
- **Extensions for Claude / Claude Code:** Plugins are packages that extend Claude’s capabilities beyond basic conversation or coding. They bundle together multiple extensibility components that Claude can load and use. citeturn0search5  
- **Components they can include:**  
  • Custom **slash commands** (quick actions you call inside Claude)  
  • Specialized **sub-agents** for particular tasks  
  • **Skills** (autonomously invoked capabilities)  
  • **Hooks** (event handlers)  
  • **MCP servers** (connectors to external tools or services) citeturn0search5

### Where They’re Used
- **Claude Code:** Plugins are primarily associated with *Claude Code*, Anthropic’s CLI/IDE-integrated agentic development tool. They let you customize workflows, automate tasks, and reuse setups across projects. citeturn0search0turn0search5  
- **Cowork enterprise:** Anthropic is adding plugin support to *Cowork* (a graphical version of Claude Code geared toward business workflows), letting teams tailor Claude to specific job functions and integrate with external tools/data sources. citeturn0search24turn0search27

### How They Work
- Plugins are **installable packages** that you add with commands like:  
  ```bash
  /plugin marketplace update claude-plugins-official  
  /plugin install <plugin-name>
  ```  
  They then make new commands, agents, and tool integrations available in your Claude Code session. citeturn0search23  
- There are both **official** and **community** plugins available in registries or marketplaces. citeturn0search1

### Ecosystem & Use Cases
- Developers use plugins for things like **code analysis, automation, project scaffolding, custom workflows, tool integrations**, etc. citeturn0search26  
- In enterprise settings, plugins can tie Claude into CRM systems, data platforms, or team workflows, exposing domain-specific commands and automations. citeturn0search27

In essence, Claude plugins are a way to turn a base AI model into a customized assistant or development partner tailored to specific tasks and tools. citeturn0search5
