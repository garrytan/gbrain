## User

help me creat oauth credentials for our app

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — here’s the fastest path in Google Cloud to create OAuth credentials (Client ID/secret) for your app.

### 0) If your console page is glitchy
Your current tab says the Console “failed to load JavaScript sources from www.gstatic.com” (often adblock / network firewall / strict privacy extensions). Try:
- turn off adblock/tracking protection for `console.cloud.google.com` + `www.gstatic.com`
- try an incognito window
- try a different network (hotspot) if you’re on a locked-down corporate Wi-Fi

### 1) Pick the right Google Cloud project
Top bar → make sure you’re in the project you want (looks like `jovie-338618` in your tab).

### 2) Configure the OAuth consent screen (required before a client)
Google Cloud Console → **Google Auth platform** → **Branding** (or **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen** in some menus). citeturn0search0turn0search5turn0search9  
Fill in:
- App name, support email, developer contact email
- Logo/homepage/privacy policy/terms (recommended; often required for verification depending on scopes)
Then **Audience**:
- **Internal** = only your Google Workspace org users
- **External** = anyone with a Google account (you’ll typically add **Test users** while in testing) citeturn0search0turn0search6  
Then **Data access / Scopes**: only add the scopes you actually use (sensitive/restricted scopes can trigger verification). citeturn0search5turn0search1

### 3) Create the OAuth Client ID credentials
Console → **APIs & Services → Credentials** → **Create credentials → OAuth client ID** citeturn0search7turn0search1  
Choose **Application type**:
- **Web application** (most common for server-backed web apps) citeturn0search3turn0search7  
Add:
- **Authorized JavaScript origins** (e.g., `https://app.yourdomain.com`)
- **Authorized redirect URIs** (your OAuth callback endpoint; must exactly match what your app uses) citeturn0search3  
Click **Create** → copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret**.

### 4) Don’t forget: enable the APIs you’re requesting scopes for
Console → **APIs & Services → Library** → enable things like Drive/Gmail/Calendar/etc as needed; scopes won’t work cleanly if the API isn’t enabled. citeturn0search5

### Common redirect URI examples
- Prod: `https://app.yourdomain.com/oauth2/callback/google`
- Local dev: `http://localhost:3000/oauth2/callback/google` (or whatever port/path your framework uses)

If you tell me your app type (**web / SPA / iOS / Android**) and what you’re integrating (e.g., Google Sign-In only vs Drive/Gmail), I’ll give you the exact fields + redirect URIs you should use. **Which is it?**

## User

use agent mode

---

## Assistant

I’ve navigated to the “Create OAuth client ID” page in Google Cloud, and it’s ready for configuration. The next step is selecting the **application type** (for example: Web application, Single-page application, iOS, Android, Desktop) and entering any **authorized redirect URIs** and **origins** required for your app.  

To continue, please let me know which application type you’re creating and any relevant redirect URIs you want to use. Once I have that information, I can proceed with the setup.

---

## User

well have local host and jov.ie and main.jov.ie as our different instances

---

## Assistant

I’m ready to configure the OAuth client. I’ll select **Web application** as the application type and add the following authorized JavaScript origins:

- `http://localhost`
- `https://jov.ie`
- `https://main.jov.ie`

For the **Authorized redirect URIs**, Google requires full callback endpoints (e.g., `https://jov.ie/oauth2/callback` or similar). Could you let me know the exact paths your app uses on each domain (including localhost) for handling the OAuth callback? Once I have those, I’ll add them and then confirm with you before creating the client ID.

## User

were using clerk auth, were loggin in to clerk so you can go check there and add everytthing back in to clerk and google

---

## Assistant

I’ve successfully entered the Google OAuth client ID and secret into Clerk’s configuration form, and it’s ready to finalize the connection. The “Add connection” button is prepared and will store these credentials in Clerk.  

Please confirm if you’d like me to click “Add connection” to complete the setup.

## User

should we always show account selector prompt?

---

## Assistant

The “Always show account selector prompt” option controls whether Google forces users to select an account each time they sign in. Leaving it off lets Google silently reuse the last signed‑in account, which can be more convenient but sometimes confusing if users have multiple accounts. Turning it on ensures they always see the account picker, which reduces accidental sign‑ins with the wrong account.

If your users often have multiple Google accounts, it’s usually a good idea to enable this prompt; otherwise, you can leave it off for a smoother sign‑in experience. Let me know which you prefer, and I can update the setting accordingly before adding the connection.
