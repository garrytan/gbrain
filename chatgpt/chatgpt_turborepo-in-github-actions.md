Here’s a practical **GitHub Actions CI setup** for a **Turborepo monorepo** — how to build/test using Turborepo in Actions, with caching and optional remote cache support.

---

## 1) Basic GitHub Actions Workflow for Turborepo

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build & Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'pnpm'                # or npm/yarn

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Turborepo build
        run: pnpm build               # runs `turbo run build`

      - name: Test
        run: pnpm test                # runs `turbo run test`
```

This runs Turborepo builds/tests on push/PR. Adjust package manager steps (npm/yarn/pnpm) as needed. citeturn0search0

---

## 2) Add Caching (Speed Up CI)

Turborepo itself caches outputs locally, but in CI you can:

**a) Remote Caching (official, Vercel Remote Cache)**  
Add environment variables from your repo settings:

```yaml
env:
  TURBO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TOKEN }}
  TURBO_TEAM: ${{ vars.TURBO_TEAM }}
```

Then Turborepo uses remote cache to speed up tasks across runs. citeturn0search0

**b) GitHub Actions Cache (local cache approach)**  
There are community Actions that set up a local cache server to make Turbo use cache stored in GitHub’s cache service, but they’re experimental. citeturn0search11

---

## 3) Only Run Affected Tasks

Turborepo can automatically detect affected projects using its `--affected` logic. GitHub Actions environment variables (`GITHUB_BASE_REF`) help Turborepo determine changed files so it only runs the necessary tasks. citeturn0search13

Usage example in scripts:

```bash
turbo run build --affected
```

---

## 4) Path Filtering (Optional)

You can also trigger workflows/job steps only if certain paths change:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - "apps/web/**"
      - "packages/ui/**"
```

This helps skip CI runs when irrelevant parts of the monorepo change. citeturn0search14

---

## 5) Example With Jest (Test + Build)

Typical workflow steps:

```yaml
- run: pnpm install
- run: pnpm test              # turbo will only run tests for changed packages
- run: pnpm build             # turbo will build only impacted packages
```

Turborepo’s dependency graph ensures dependent tasks run correctly. citeturn0search27

---

## 6) Deployment (GitHub Actions + Vercel)

If deploying to Vercel, you can add steps like:

```yaml
- name: Vercel Deploy
  run: npx vercel --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

Combine this with Turbo’s build caching before deployment. citeturn0search16

---

## Notes / Best Practices

- Always **checkout full history (depth 2)** so Turborepo can compare commits. citeturn0search0
- Use **remote caching** for best CI speed.
- You can split jobs for build/test or per app, but the basic workflow above works for most repos. citeturn0search1

If you want, I can tailor a complete CI + deploy workflow for your specific package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn) and apps (Next.js, Node, etc.).

## User

where do i get the env keys for hitgub acitons

---

## Assistant

Mr. White —

You get **environment keys for GitHub Actions** from **your GitHub repository or organization settings**, not from the workflow file itself.

---

## 1) GitHub Actions **Secrets** (most common)

Use this for tokens, API keys, credentials.

### Where to add them
1. Go to your repo on **entity["company","GitHub","code hosting platform"]**
2. **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Add:
   - **Name** (e.g. `TURBO_TOKEN`)
   - **Value** (the actual secret)

### How you use them in workflows
```yaml
env:
  TURBO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TOKEN }}
```

---

## 2) GitHub Actions **Variables** (non-secret config)

Use this for non-sensitive values (team names, flags, env names).

### Where to add them
- **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
- Tab: **Variables**
- Click **New repository variable**

Example:
```yaml
env:
  TURBO_TEAM: ${{ vars.TURBO_TEAM }}
```

---

## 3) Turborepo-Specific Keys (Common Case)

If you’re using **Turborepo Remote Cache (Vercel)**:

### Where the values come from
- **TURBO_TOKEN**  
  → Generated in the **Vercel dashboard** (Account → Tokens)

- **TURBO_TEAM**  
  → Your Vercel team slug (or username)

### Then add both to GitHub:
- `TURBO_TOKEN` → **Secret**
- `TURBO_TEAM` → **Variable** (or Secret, either works)

---

## 4) Organization-Level Secrets (optional, best practice)

If multiple repos need the same key:
- **Organization → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
- Add once, share across repos

---

## 5) Environment-Specific Secrets (prod/staging)

If you use GitHub Environments:
- **Settings → Environments → prod**
- Add secrets scoped only to that environment
- Reference them the same way (`secrets.X`)

---

## Minimal Checklist

- Secrets → **credentials / tokens**
- Variables → **non-sensitive config**
- Referenced as:
  - `secrets.NAME`
  - `vars.NAME`

---

If you want, tell me **which tool** you’re integrating (Turborepo remote cache, Vercel deploy, AWS, GCP, etc.), and I’ll give you the **exact keys + where to generate each one**.

---

## User

i cant find TURBO_TOKEN in verccl

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — this is a **common point of confusion**.  
**`TURBO_TOKEN` does NOT appear as a pre-named token in Vercel. You must create it yourself.**

---

## Where `TURBO_TOKEN` Actually Comes From

`TURBO_TOKEN` is just a **Vercel Personal Access Token** that Turborepo uses.  
You **name it `TURBO_TOKEN` in GitHub**, but in Vercel it’s just a normal token.

---

## How to Create It (Correct Path)

1. Go to **entity["company","Vercel","cloud deployment platform"]**
2. Click your **avatar (top-right)**
3. **Settings**
4. **Tokens**
5. Click **Create Token**
   - Name: `turborepo-ci` (any name is fine)
   - Scope: **Full Account** (recommended for cache access)
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won’t see it again)

This copied value **is your `TURBO_TOKEN`**.

---

## Where to Put It in GitHub

In **entity["company","GitHub","code hosting platform"]**:

- Repo → **Settings**
- **Secrets and variables → Actions**
- **New repository secret**

| Field | Value |
|-----|------|
| Name | `TURBO_TOKEN` |
| Value | *(paste token from Vercel)* |

---

## `TURBO_TEAM` (Often Missed)

This is **NOT a token**.

- If you use a Vercel team:  
  → Team **slug** (URL-safe name)
- If personal account:  
  → Your **Vercel username**

Add it as:
- **Variable** (preferred) or Secret

```yaml
env:
  TURBO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TOKEN }}
  TURBO_TEAM: ${{ vars.TURBO_TEAM }}
```

---

## Quick Validation

Run locally once to confirm:
```bash
npx turbo run build --dry
```

In CI logs you should see:
```
Remote caching enabled
```

If you see:
```
Remote cache disabled
```
→ token or team is wrong.

---

## Hard Truth (Value > Opinion)

- Vercel **does not label anything “TURBO_TOKEN”**
- Docs assume you understand this abstraction
- 90% of failures are:
  - Token copied incorrectly
  - Wrong team slug
  - Token added as variable instead of secret

---

If you want, tell me:
- **Personal vs Team Vercel account**
- **pnpm / npm / yarn**
- **Next.js or backend only**

I’ll give you a **drop-in CI file that just works**.
