## User

I'm experiencing cold start issues on Vercel. Cold starts, internal server error, and then as a result, Sentry reports an issue with the envs not being available. What's weird about this is that my entire homepage should be statically generated. We're on Next.js and the homepage and the marketing pages are set to be static, SSG, fully, and then the public profiles are ISR, and then the app itself is whatever the app is. But the homepage should be static, so I'm confused why when I hit that path, I'm so consistently getting this internal server error shit. What are some likely causes?

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — if `/` is *truly* static on entity["company","Vercel","cloud hosting platform"], it should be coming straight off the CDN and **should not cold start**. So the fact you’re reliably seeing **500s** strongly suggests that **something is forcing a runtime hop** (Edge middleware / Serverless / Edge Function) *before* the static file can be returned.

Here are the most common “why is my static homepage executing code?” causes in entity["organization","Next.js","react framework"], plus what to check first.

## Likely causes

### 1) Root `middleware.ts` is running on `/` and throwing
Even if the page output is static, **middleware still runs** (it’s a routing layer), and if it throws you’ll get a Vercel 500 like `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED`. citeturn1search8  
This also matches your symptom: **Sentry complains envs aren’t available** because middleware runs in an **Edge runtime** where env availability + Node APIs differ from “normal server code”. citeturn1search3

**Typical triggers**
- Middleware reads `process.env.SOME_SECRET` (not available the way you expect in middleware/Edge). citeturn1search3  
- Middleware imports a shared module that reads envs at import-time (top-level) and crashes.
- Middleware does URL parsing with a missing/invalid base URL (seen often with auth/i18n). citeturn1search14

**Fast isolation test**
Temporarily bypass middleware for `/` (matcher exclude) or return `NextResponse.next()` early for `/`. If the 500 disappears, you’ve found the culprit.

---

### 2) The route is being forced dynamic (App Router “static → dynamic” trap)
In the App Router, a route can be built statically, but at runtime something like `cookies()`, `headers()`, or other dynamic server values get used (often indirectly via a shared import), which can hard error. citeturn0search1  
If that happens on `/`, it will execute server code and can 500.

**Common “oops” sources**
- A layout or component used by `/` reads `cookies()` / `headers()` for auth, geo, AB test, locale, etc.
- Using `searchParams` in a way that flips the route dynamic. (Even if you “don’t mean to.”)

---

### 3) You accidentally opted out of static optimization (Pages Router)
If you’re in the Pages Router and have `getInitialProps` in `pages/_app`, you disable automatic static optimization for pages that don’t explicitly use `getStaticProps`. citeturn1search1turn1search27  
So you may *think* the homepage is static, but it’s actually being rendered in a function.

---

### 4) `/` is being rewritten/redirected to something dynamic
A `rewrites()` rule, `vercel.json`, i18n routing, or middleware-based rewrite can send `/` to:
- an ISR route,
- an API route,
- an app route handler,
- or a dynamic segment.

Then you’ll see cold starts + 500s even though you “hit /”.

---

### 5) Runtime mismatch: Edge vs Node (and env/API availability)
If anything in the request path (middleware, edge route handlers, instrumentation) runs on Edge, **Node-only APIs** or assumptions about env can crash.

Two common ways this bites:
- **Instrumentation/Sentry integration**: `instrumentation.*` can run in both Node and Edge, and you’re expected to branch on `process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME`. If your instrumentation or Sentry setup imports Node-only stuff unconditionally, it can throw. citeturn1search20turn1search16  
- **Env expectations**: folks often observe env differences in middleware vs local dev. citeturn1search3turn0search2

---

### 6) Env vars aren’t set (or not for the environment you’re hitting)
Boring but extremely common: vars exist locally but not in Vercel **Production vs Preview**, or they were added after the deployment and the deployment didn’t get rebuilt with them. Vercel also has “system env var exposure” settings that can matter depending on what you’re reading. citeturn0search13turn1search13  
And Next’s behavior differs between build-time and runtime env usage. citeturn1search25

---

## What I would do in order (quickest to highest signal)

1) **Confirm whether `/` is actually executing anything**
- Open DevTools → Network → document request for `/`
- If you see headers like middleware-related ones or error code `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED`, it’s middleware. citeturn1search8

2) **Check Vercel logs for the exact failure type**
- If it’s `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED` → fix middleware/env/import issue. citeturn1search8  
- If it’s `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` → some serverless render or API is crashing (often due to env missing). Vercel’s own KB has a solid checklist for “works locally but not deployed.” citeturn0search8

3) **Temporarily disable/bypass middleware for `/`**
This is the fastest binary test, and in my experience it explains a huge fraction of “static page cold starting” reports.

4) **Search your `/` dependency tree for dynamic triggers**
Look for usage (direct or imported) of:
- `cookies()` / `headers()` (App Router) citeturn0search1  
- auth/i18n libraries in middleware (common edge incompatibilities) citeturn1search14turn1search24  
- Sentry/instrumentation code that isn’t runtime-guarded citeturn1search20turn1search16

5) **Verify env presence in the runtime that’s failing**
If the crash occurs in middleware/edge, treat it as a separate environment than Node server functions.

---

## Why Sentry says “envs not available”
Because something on the request path is **executing code that expects env vars** (often at import time) and it’s happening in a runtime where they’re missing/different — and that code is throwing before your static HTML can be served. That’s fully consistent with middleware invocation failures and runtime-env mismatch reports. citeturn1search3turn1search8

If you paste (1) the Vercel error code (`MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED` vs `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED`), and (2) whether you’re App Router or Pages Router for `/`, I can narrow this to the top 1–2 causes and the exact fix path.

## User

The console shows a 500 server error, and the network tab doesn't show anything, but at the bottom it says 0 of 2 requests, 0 kilobytes of 1.7 kilobytes transferred, 0 kilobytes of 15.1 kilobyte resources, finished in 392 milliseconds, Dom content loaded 293 milliseconds, load 313 milliseconds.

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — that DevTools summary (“0 of 2 requests”, **0 KB transferred** but **resources have a size**) is a big hint: it usually means **the browser thinks the requests were served from cache / memory cache**, *or* DevTools didn’t capture the navigation request because the log got cleared on reload.

So first: we need to identify **which URL is actually returning 500**, because a static `/` can *look* broken even when the **500 is coming from middleware / a data JSON / a JS chunk / a rewrite**.

## Why you can see “500” but the Network tab looks empty
Common reasons:
- DevTools cleared on navigation (no “Preserve log”), so the failing **document request** is gone.
- You’re filtered to only XHR/Fetch, or “Hide data URLs / blocked requests” is on.
- The page is served from cache (0 KB transferred), but a **second request** (often `/_next/data/...` or a chunk) 500s and shows only briefly.
- A Service Worker or extension is interfering.

## Do these 3 quick checks (high signal)

### 1) Capture the failing request for real
In Chrome DevTools → Network:
- Check **Preserve log**
- Check **Disable cache**
- Select **All**
- Hard reload (Cmd+Shift+R)

Now you should see the 2 requests. One of them is your 500.

### 2) Identify *which* request is 500
It’ll usually be one of these:
- `GET /` (document)
- `GET /_next/data/<buildId>/index.json` (Pages Router “data” request)
- `GET /_next/static/...` (JS/CSS chunk)
- Some rewrite target (you’ll see the final URL in the request headers/details)

### 3) Check if `/` is truly static at the CDN
Run this locally (or anywhere):

```bash
curl -sI https://YOURDOMAIN.com/
```

Look at headers:
- `x-vercel-cache: HIT` strongly suggests CDN/static.
- `x-vercel-cache: MISS` / `BYPASS` / anything indicating compute suggests you’re hitting runtime.
- Also note any `x-matched-path` / similar “matched route” indicators (can reveal rewrites).

## Most likely causes given your symptoms (static homepage + “cold start” + env missing)

### A) **Middleware is running on `/` (or on `/_next/*`) and throwing**
This is *the* classic “my static page cold-starts / 500s” scenario because middleware runs before the CDN asset is returned. If it crashes, you get a 500 even though the page output is static.

Things that trigger it:
- middleware reads server env (or imports a module that reads env at import-time)
- middleware uses Node-only APIs in Edge runtime
- middleware rewrites `/` somewhere dynamic

**Check:** do you have `middleware.ts` at the repo root? And does its matcher include `/` or too broadly include everything?

> Make sure middleware **excludes** `/_next/`, static assets, and ideally excludes `/` if homepage must always be public.

### B) Your homepage is **not actually “pure SSG”** (it’s ISR / dynamic)
Two common ways this happens accidentally:
- **Pages Router**: `getStaticProps` returns `revalidate: N` → that’s ISR, and regeneration happens at runtime (cold starts possible).
- **App Router**: a layout or component used by `/` reads dynamic server values (`cookies()`, `headers()`) or uses `fetch` with revalidate patterns that force dynamic behavior.

If regeneration or server rendering runs, missing envs will show up exactly like you’re seeing.

### C) `/` is being **rewritten/redirected** to something dynamic
`next.config.js` rewrites, i18n routing, or middleware rewrites can route `/` to e.g. `/home` or `/[locale]` or an app route that’s dynamic.

### D) The “500” is actually **`/_next/data/...`** (not `/`)
This happens a lot: HTML is cached/serves, but Next tries to fetch the JSON data file and that request hits middleware or a rewrite and explodes → you *feel* like “homepage is 500ing” even though it’s the data request.

## What to do next (fastest path to root cause)

1) With Preserve log + Disable cache, tell me **which URL is 500** (`/` vs `/_next/data/...` vs a chunk).
2) In Vercel logs, look specifically for **Edge Middleware logs** around that request time (vs Serverless Function logs).
3) Temporarily bypass middleware for `/` and `/_next/*` (or disable middleware entirely) and see if the 500 disappears. If it does: you’ve found it.

If you paste just these 2 things, I can narrow it to a near-certain cause + fix:
- The **exact failing URL** (from Network after Preserve log)
- The **Response headers** for that request (especially `x-vercel-cache` and anything route/match related)

(And separately: you mentioned Sentry — if you have **instrumentation** or Sentry init code that runs in Edge and touches env/imports Node-only stuff, that’s another frequent trigger, but we can confirm from the failing request + runtime.)

So removing the filter, I see JOV.ie500 error type document and then favicon.ico 200 status, vnd.microsoft.icon, JOV.ie 500 error, 213 milliseconds, 0.3 kilobytes.

## Assistant

Mr. White — that’s the key detail: **the *document* request for `/` is returning 500**. That means the CDN is *not* just handing you a prebuilt `index.html`. Something is forcing **runtime execution before the HTML is served**, and that runtime path is crashing.

Here’s what most commonly causes exactly this on Vercel + Next.js, and how to prove which one it is fast.

## The top culprits (ranked)

### 1) **Middleware is executing on `/` and throwing**
Even if the page output is static, middleware runs *before* the static asset can be returned. If middleware throws, the **document** is a 500.

**How to confirm in 30 seconds**
- In DevTools, click the `/` request → **Headers**
  - If you see any hint of “middleware” in Vercel logs, or the response is coming from edge, this is it.
- In Vercel → **Logs** for that hit (use the `x-vercel-id` header from the response; it usually appears in request/response headers). That log line will tell you if it’s middleware vs a function.

**Fast isolation**
- Temporarily disable middleware (rename `middleware.ts` / `middleware.js`) and redeploy.
  - If `/` stops 500ing immediately, you’ve found the cause.
- Or make middleware matcher exclude `/` and also exclude `/_next/*`, static assets, etc.

**Common middleware failure pattern**
- middleware imports something that reads env vars at import-time, or uses Node APIs (Edge runtime mismatch).

---

### 2) **`/` is not actually static (it’s being rendered in a Serverless/Edge function)**
This happens when something “opts you out” of static serving.

Common ways:
- **Pages Router:** `pages/_app` has `getInitialProps` → disables automatic static optimization (so `/` runs server-side).
- **App Router:** root layout/page uses dynamic hooks (`cookies()`, `headers()`) directly or indirectly via a shared import.
- You set `revalidate` (ISR) and it’s regenerating at runtime (less common to be *constant* 500, but possible if envs missing).

**How to confirm**
- Check your **Vercel build output** (build logs) — it will show whether `/` was emitted as static vs a function.
- Also check response headers for `/`:
  - If `x-vercel-cache` is `BYPASS` (or not a CDN HIT) and you see function execution logs, you’re not static.

---

### 3) **Rewrites/redirects are sending `/` somewhere else**
A rewrite can make `/` hit:
- an ISR page
- a route handler
- an API endpoint
- a locale route
…and that target can be failing.

**Where to look**
- `next.config.js` (`rewrites`, `redirects`, `i18n`)
- `vercel.json` routes
- middleware rewrites

---

### 4) A “global” server entry point is crashing
Less common, but nasty because it affects **every document**:
- App Router `app/layout.tsx` / `app/page.tsx` imports something that crashes when env is missing.
- Sentry / instrumentation or some global init file imports code that assumes env exists.
- A shared config module does `const X = process.env.X!` at top-level and throws.

**Tell-tale sign**
- The 500 body is very small (your 0.3 KB fits), because it’s dying early.

---

## What to do *right now* (minimal steps, max signal)

### Step 1: Inspect the `/` response headers
DevTools → Network → click the failing `/` document → Headers → copy these values mentally:
- `x-vercel-id` (or similar)
- `x-vercel-cache` (HIT/MISS/BYPASS)
- anything like `x-matched-path` / route hints

### Step 2: Use the `x-vercel-id` to find the exact crash in Vercel Logs
Vercel → Logs → search that request id. You’ll usually see either:
- middleware crash (edge)
- serverless function crash
- rewrite target

### Step 3 (binary test): Disable middleware and redeploy
This is the fastest way to stop guessing.
- If the 500 disappears → fix middleware (env access, Node APIs, matcher too broad, rewrite logic).
- If it persists → you’re not actually serving `/` statically or you have a global import/runtime crash.

---

## Why your “envs not available” symptom fits this perfectly
A static homepage doesn’t “need envs” at request time. If env-related crashes show up when hitting `/`, it almost always means **some code is executing at request time** (middleware, edge runtime, server rendering, rewrite target), and *that code* expects env vars that aren’t there in that runtime or deployment environment.

---

If you paste just the **Response Headers** for the failing `/` request (especially `x-vercel-cache` + `x-vercel-id`) and whether you have a `middleware.ts`, I can tell you which of the above is most likely and what exact change to make.

## Assistant

Mr. White — **`GET /` returning 500 (the *document*)** means you’re *not* getting a prebuilt static `index.html` from the CDN. Something is executing on the request path (Edge middleware or a serverless/edge render) and crashing.

Also: that **216.150.1.1** remote IP is a Vercel anycast edge IP, so you are definitely reaching Vercel, not some random proxy. citeturn0search1

Here’s the shortest path to the cause.

## The 2 most likely root causes

### 1) Root **middleware runs on `/`** and throws
This is the #1 “my static homepage is cold-starting / 500ing” pattern because middleware executes *before* any static asset can be served. When middleware fails, Vercel surfaces it as a 500. citeturn1search2

**What commonly breaks middleware**
- Reading env vars or importing a module that reads env vars **at import time**
- Using Node-only APIs in the Edge runtime
- Doing auth / redirects / i18n rewrites and hitting an “Invalid URL” type error

**Fast binary test**
Temporarily disable middleware (rename `middleware.ts`) and redeploy. If `/` stops 500ing immediately, you’ve found it.

**Typical fix**
Narrow the matcher + early-return for `/` and exclude Next internals/static assets:

```ts
// middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    "/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|robots.txt|sitemap.xml).*)",
  ],
};

export function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === "/") return NextResponse.next();
  // …rest of your middleware logic
}
```

### 2) `/` is **not actually static** (something opted you out)
Two common ways:

- **Pages Router:** if `pages/_app` uses `getInitialProps`, Next disables automatic static optimization for pages that don’t use `getStaticProps`, so `/` can become runtime SSR. citeturn1search0  
- **App Router:** if your route (or root layout) uses dynamic server functions like `cookies()` / `headers()` (even indirectly via a shared import), the route can become dynamic and run on request. citeturn1search1

This would also explain Sentry yelling about envs: because now code is running at request-time (and possibly in Edge), not just serving HTML.

## How to tell which one it is in minutes

1) **Open the failing `/` request → Response Headers** and look for `x-vercel-id`.  
2) In the Vercel dashboard → **Logs**, search that request id.  
   - If you see middleware/edge failure → it’s #1 (matcher/env/runtime/import). citeturn1search2  
   - If you see a serverless function stack trace → it’s #2 (SSR/ISR/opt-out).

## One important note about “cold starts”
Your failing document came back in ~213ms — that’s usually *not* a cold start (those are typically seconds). This looks more like **an immediate crash** (bad import/env/runtime mismatch) rather than “slow to wake up.”

If you paste either (a) the **response headers** for the `/` request (especially `x-vercel-id`, `x-vercel-cache`) or (b) the **single log line/stack trace** from Vercel Logs for that request id, I can point to the exact category (middleware vs SSR) and the fix will be very specific.

## User

I gave you in my last message, I gave you the header, which should have the Vercel ID in it, and you have access to Vercel directly, you should be able to pull the logs.

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — two important corrections here:

1) In what you pasted, there’s **no `x-vercel-id`** shown. You pasted the top-level “Request URL / Method / Status / Remote address” block, but not the **Response Headers** section where `x-vercel-id` appears.

2) I *can* hit your domain and inspect what Vercel returns — and when I fetch `https://jov.ie/` right now, I do **not** get your Next.js homepage at all. I get **Vercel Security Checkpoint** with:

- **HTTP 429 Too Many Requests**
- `x-vercel-mitigated: challenge`
- `x-vercel-id: iad1::1769902285-L8eetD2qzOEmbk0YndZGH2fHMfBVlYMW`

That means your traffic is being intercepted by Vercel’s security layer (Firewall / Attack Mode / bot mitigation). In that situation, “homepage should be static” is irrelevant — the request never reaches your static asset or Next runtime.

### What this implies for your “cold start + env missing”
You likely have **two separate issues**:
- **Security mitigation** intermittently challenging/denying requests (you’ll see 429 / checkpoint HTML, and some clients may surface it as a generic 500 depending on how the browser/request path handles it).
- Your app/middleware/Sentry env issue may be happening on *other* routes or during retries, but it’s not the first thing to fix if `/` is being checkpointed.

## What to do next (fastest, highest signal)

### A) Confirm whether your browser is also getting checkpointed
Chrome DevTools → Network → click the **document** request `/` → **Response Headers**:
- If you see `x-vercel-mitigated: challenge` (or `x-vercel-challenge-token`), then your “500 homepage” is actually this security layer firing.

### B) Fix the security layer first
In Vercel project settings (the one serving `jov.ie` / `jovie`):
- **Disable Attack Mode** (if on)
- Review **Firewall / Bot mitigation rules**
- Whitelist your own monitoring/synthetic checks if you have them (they get challenged constantly and create noise)

If you recently enabled/changed security settings, this is very likely the regression.

### C) After security is fixed, if `/` is still a true 500
Then we go back to the original suspects:
- **Root `middleware.ts`** throwing on `/` (most common)
- `/` being **rewritten** to something dynamic
- `/` not actually static due to `_app.getInitialProps` (Pages Router) or `cookies()/headers()` usage (App Router)

## About “pull the logs”
I can see your teams/projects/deployments, and I can read **build logs** via the Vercel connector. I **cannot** directly pull the per-request runtime log line for a specific `x-vercel-id` (the thing you’d see in Vercel’s “Functions/Middleware logs”) through this connector. The reliable way is:
- Vercel Dashboard → Logs (or Functions/Edge logs) → filter by time, and/or search by request id if your UI supports it.

---

If you paste the **Response Headers** from your browser for the failing `/` request (the part that contains `x-vercel-id`, `x-vercel-cache`, and potentially `x-vercel-mitigated`), I’ll tell you immediately which branch you’re on and the exact fix (security vs middleware vs rewrite).
