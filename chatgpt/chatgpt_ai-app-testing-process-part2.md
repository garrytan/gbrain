**Everything can be scripted—nothing forces you into the web UI—but some pieces live in different layers.**

| Item | Where it lives today | Can you create / update by code? | How |
|------|----------------------|----------------------------------|-----|
| **Workflows** (`web-build`, `ios-ci`, …) | YAML in repo | ✅ | Already done in `.github/workflows/*.yml` |
| **Environments** (`preview`, `staging`, `production`) | Server-side object that holds rules & secrets | ✅ | GitHub REST API or `gh api` CLI citeturn0search3 |
| **Environment secrets** (Vercel, Supabase…) | Per-environment vault | ✅ | `gh secret set NAME -e production -R owner/repo` citeturn0search0 |
| **Required reviewers / wait timer** | Environment protection rules | ✅ | Same API call that creates/updates the environment |
| **Branch-protection rules** (`main`, `dev`, `preview/*`) | Repo settings | ✅ | `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/:branch/protection -X PUT …` |
| **Repo-level secrets** (MATCH_PASSWORD…) | Repo vault | ✅ | `gh secret set NAME -R owner/repo` |

---

### 1. Script the environments once

```bash
# GH_TOKEN must have "repo" + "admin:repo_hook" scopes
export GH_TOKEN=ghp_xxx

OWNER=timwhite
REPO=LogYourBody

create_env () {
  local ENV=$1 REVIEWER_LOGIN=$2
  gh api                                               \
    --method PUT                                      \
    "/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/environments/$ENV"           \
    -f deployment_branch_policy.null=true             \
    -F reviewers[0].type=User                         \
    -F reviewers[0].reviewer=$REVIEWER_LOGIN          \
    -f wait_timer=0
}

create_env preview  ""            # no reviewer
create_env staging  "timwhite"    # 1 reviewer
create_env production "timwhite"  # prod gate
```

Add secrets:

```bash
echo "$VERCEL_TOKEN_PROD" | gh secret set VERCEL_TOKEN_PROD -e production -R $OWNER/$REPO
echo "$VERCEL_TOKEN_STAGING"| gh secret set VERCEL_TOKEN_STAGING -e staging -R $OWNER/$REPO
```

---

### 2. Branch-protection as code

```bash
protect () {
  local BRANCH=$1 APPROVALS=$2
  gh api -X PUT "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/branches/$BRANCH/protection" \
    -f required_status_checks.strict=true                       \
    -F required_status_checks.contexts[]=ci-summary              \
    -F required_status_checks.contexts[]=web-build               \
    -F required_status_checks.contexts[]=ios-ci                  \
    -f required_pull_request_reviews.dismiss_stale_reviews=true  \
    -f required_pull_request_reviews.required_approving_review_count=$APPROVALS \
    -f enforce_admins=true
}
protect main   2
protect dev    1
```

*(Wild-card rules like `preview/*` use the “Branch protection rule” API endpoint and a glob pattern.)*

---

### 3. Keep it DRY: store the shell above in `.github/scripts/bootstrap-ci.sh`  
Run it once (`workflow_dispatch`) or any time you need to re-sync repo settings.

---

### 4. What **cannot** go in YAML

- Secrets’ **values** (for obvious security reasons).  
  You script `gh secret set`, but you never commit them.  
- Environment rules: they’re referenced in YAML (`environment: production`) but the “required reviewers” flag itself is server-side metadata, so you hit the API as shown.

---

### 5. When the UI is still handy

Occasional tweaks (e.g., adding a new reviewer) are faster in **Settings ▸ Environments**, but you can 100 % stay in the terminal if you prefer—the API covers every toggle.


Give me a prompt to give to claude code to have it check out GitHub action workflows and ensure that they lead to rock solid releases and fit all our requirements 


**Claude prompt — “Workflow Guardian”**

```
SYSTEM
You are *Workflow Guardian*, an autonomous coding agent with push access to
<REPO_URL>.  
Mission: audit and harden every GitHub Actions workflow so that the project meets
the “rock-solid release” standard defined below.  
Stop only when the default branch’s latest run is 100 % green and all gates pass.

------------------------------------------------------------------
“ROCK-SOLID” STANDARD  (do not relax)
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. 0 lint violations, 0 compiler warnings (warnings-as-errors).
2. Unit & UI tests 100 % pass, coverage ≥ 80 % core targets.
3. Build artefacts reproducible, no flaky steps or hidden ‘continue-on-error’.
4. Web: TypeScript strict, ESLint strict, Next.js build succeeds.
5. iOS: SwiftLint strict, SwiftFormat auto-fix, Fastlane `ci` lane green.
6. Performance gate: 95th-percentile frame ≤ 16 ms (nightly), no persistent leaks.
7. Layout-shift & snapshot tests pass.
8. Code duplicated ≥ 3 identical lines (non-test) must be refactored.
9. Workflows use environments:
   • preview  ←  preview/* branches  
   • staging  ←  dev  
   • production ← main (manual approval, concurrency = 1)
10. Deploy jobs run only after CI passes and target the correct environment.
11. No unapproved third-party actions (<100 ★) or deprecated versions.
12. All caches keyed to lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `Package.resolved`).
13. All secrets referenced are environment-scoped and exist.
14. Workflow YAMLs contain explicit `timeout-minutes`.

------------------------------------------------------------------
HARD CONSTRAINTS
------------------------------------------------------------------
• Touch only files inside `.github/**`, `fastlane/`, or CI helper scripts.
• Every commit: Conventional Commit header (`fix(ci): …`, `chore(workflow): …`).
• Commit body: *why* change was needed, link to failing run URL.
• Never silence a failing job; solve root cause.
• Ask in PR comment before adding dependencies or changing runtime versions.

------------------------------------------------------------------
RECURSIVE LOOP (until exit criteria met)
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. DIAGNOSE  
   – Fetch latest failed / yellow run via GitHub API.  
   – Parse job + step logs; list violations against the standard.

2. PLAN  
   – Draft minimal YAML (or script) diff for the top-priority violation.  
   – Predict impact on other jobs, keeping runtimes reasonable.

3. PATCH  
   – Apply diff on branch `ci-hardening/<shortdesc>`, push.

4. TEST  
   – Trigger workflow, wait for completion.

5. REFLECT  
   – If any gate fails, repeat from DIAGNOSE on new head.  
   – Else open / update PR with “✅ Rock-solid CI achieved”, and exit.

------------------------------------------------------------------
EXIT CRITERIA
------------------------------------------------------------------
• Latest run on default branch = all jobs green, no warnings.  
• All standards above satisfied (verified in logs/artifacts).  
• PR with summary of changes ready for human merge.

------------------------------------------------------------------
STARTING INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------
Begin with **DIAGNOSE** on the most recent run of branch `dev`.  
Return ONLY the prioritized TODO list and await my explicit **“GO”** before applying fixes.
```

*Replace `<REPO_URL>` with your repository URL, paste this as the prompt to Claude Code, and reply “GO” when you want it to start the hardening loop.*


Review it yourself and then make recommendations 


### Snapshot of what you shipped

| Area | Observations |
|------|--------------|
| **Workflow count** | `main.yml` (big mono-job), `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`, `promote-environment.yml`, `deploy-production.yml`. |
| **Branch flow** | `dev → preview → main` promotion + manual iOS release. |
| **Environments** | Only the production iOS job is actually *bound* to an environment; web deploys & migrations run with repo-level secrets. |
| **Tooling** | Node 20, Vercel CLI, Supabase CLI, no Fastlane in CI, GH CLI used in several steps. |

---

### High-priority gaps

1. **False-green CI** – `npm run lint` and `npm test` are marked `continue-on-error` fileciteturn0file2.  
   Anything can break and the pipeline still deploys.

2. **Uninstalled `gh` CLI** – You call `gh pr …` in **three** places, but never install it citeturn0file0turn0file2.  
   Ubuntu runners don’t ship with GH CLI, so those steps will 404.

3. **Duplicate Dependabot logic** – Separate workflow **and** a job inside `main.yml`; they can fight for the same PR lock citeturn0file0turn0file2.

4. **No cache for iOS gems** – `deploy-production.yml` installs Bundler gems every run; job easily exceeds 15 min on first run citeturn0file1.

5. **Missing perf / leak gates** – Nothing enforces frame-time, memory, or snapshot tests, despite your “rock-solid” bar.

6. **Secrets not environment-scoped** – Web deploy uses plain repo secrets; a PR from a fork could exfiltrate them with a crafted push event.

7. **Promotion workflow reviewers placeholder** – `senior-reviewer-username` is hard-coded and will block merges citeturn0file3.

8. **Branch-protection & env approvals not enforced** – Workflows assume rules exist but never reference them (no required-status-check list, no required reviewers except iOS env).

---

### Targeted fixes

| Fix | Why / How |
|-----|-----------|
| **Fail fast on lint & tests** | Remove `continue-on-error`; if you need flaky-test headroom, wrap in a `run: retry 2 my_script`. |
| **Install GH CLI once** | Add a reusable action step:<br>`uses: cli/gh-action@v2` (or `apt-get install gh`) before any `gh` command. |
| **Consolidate Dependabot merge** | Keep the standalone `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`; delete the `auto-merge-dependabot` job inside `main.yml`. |
| **Add gem cache in iOS deploy** | Same pattern as Node:<br>`actions/cache` on `apps/ios/vendor/bundle` keyed to `Gemfile.lock`. |
| **Introduce perf/leak nightly** | New workflow on `schedule:` that calls `bundle exec fastlane perf` (Time Profiler) and `leaks` lanes; fail on regression. |
| **Use environments for web** | ```yaml
   environment: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && 'production' || github.ref == 'refs/heads/preview' && 'staging' || 'preview' }}
   ```  
  then move Vercel & Supabase secrets to those envs and set **required reviewers = 1** on `production`. |
| **Tighten branch rules** | Require status checks: `build-and-deploy`, `migrate`, and the new nightly gates on `main`. |
| **Parameterise reviewer in promotion** | Read from a repo secret or org team: `reviewers: ${{ secrets.PROD_REVIEWERS }}` to avoid hard-coding. |
| **Timeouts** | Bump `build-and-deploy` to 20 min; iOS release to 60 min + `fail-fast: false` on matrices. |
| **Deploy optimisation** | Cache `.next/cache` and call `vercel --prebuilt` to skip remote build; speeds up pushes to `preview`/`dev`. |

### Quick “starter” diff for the most critical job

```yaml
# main.yml (excerpt)
- run: npm run lint
- run: npm test
+ run: |
+   npm run lint
+   npm test
# remove continue-on-error flags

- name: Install GH CLI
  uses: cli/gh-action@v2
```

---

Tackle items **1→3** first; they block reliable merges today.  
Then move secrets into **environments** and layer in perf/leak gates to hit your “rock-solid” definition.


Itstimwhite is the senior reviewer.

| ✅ Fixed | ⚠️ Still open / newly introduced |
|---------|----------------------------------|

| Added Ruby-gem cache to production deploy. | **Dependabot workflow has no GH CLI install**, so `gh pr merge` will 127-out. fileciteturn1file0 |
| Dynamic `environment:` expression now shields fork-PR secrets. | Dependabot flow **doesn’t run tests** before merging; relies on branch rules that don’t fire in its own job context. |
| Supabase migrations gated behind diff-check. | **iOS CI lane disappeared** (only manual App-Store deploy remains). No unit-tests or leak/perf checks run on pushes. fileciteturn1file2 |
| Node cache switched to Setup-Node’s builtin cache. | `latest-stable` Xcode can jump mid-cycle; pin (`15.4` today) for reproducibility. fileciteturn1file1 |

---

### Fast fixes (copy-paste snippets)

1. **Reviewer name**

```yaml
# promote-environment.yml
reviewers: ${{ inputs.target_branch == 'main' && 'itstimwhite' || '' }}
```

2. **GH CLI once for Dependabot**

```yaml
jobs:
  auto-merge:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: cli/gh-action@v2          # <-- install GH CLI
    - name: Fetch metadata
      ...
```

3. **Smoke-test Dependabot PR before merge**

```yaml
- name: Run workflow on PR branch
  run: gh workflow run "Main CI/CD" -F branch="${{ github.head_ref }}"
  env: { GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} }

- name: Wait for CI to pass
  run: gh run watch --exit-status
  env: { GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} }
```

4. **Re-introduce iOS CI (fastlane lane only when iOS files change)**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ios-ci.yml
name: iOS CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [dev, preview, main]
    paths:
      - 'apps/ios/**'
jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: macos-14
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with: { ruby-version: '3.3' }
      - run: bundle install
      - run: bundle exec fastlane ci   # runs lint + unit/UI + snapshot
```

5. **Pin Xcode in production deploy**

```yaml
with:
  xcode-version: '15.4'
```

---

### Medium-term

| Goal | Suggestion |
|------|-----------|
| **Perf + leak gates** | Nightly workflow calling `fastlane perf` / `leaks` lanes; fail on regression. |
| **Environment-scoped secrets for web** | Move Vercel & Supabase tokens into `preview`, `staging`, `production` environments; reference them via `environment:` in main.yml. |
| **Timeouts** | Bump `build-and-deploy` to 15 min to avoid premature kills on cold caches. |
| **Dependabot auto-merge safety** | Add branch protection rule: require `build-and-deploy` green before merge (works even when bot merges itself). |

With those tweaks the pipelines will line up with the “rock-solid, reviewer-gated” standard you’re after.

### ⚠️ Still blocking “rock-solid” status

| Issue | Detail / Fix |
|-------|--------------|
| **Reviewer placeholder not replaced** | `promote-environment.yml` still sets reviewers to `senior-reviewer-username`. Swap for `itstimwhite` (or use a secret/TEAM). fileciteturn2file4 |
| **GitHub CLI not installed in Dependabot jobs** | Both `check-tests` and `comment-manual-review` call `gh …`, but no install step exists, so they’ll fail with `gh: command not found`. Add:<br>`- uses: cli/gh-action@v2` *or* apt-get GH CLI before any `gh` command. fileciteturn2file0 |
| **Secrets unavailable in fork PRs** | `main.yml` passes Supabase secrets to `npm test` even on external PRs. When a fork triggers the workflow those values are blank → runtime failures. Provide fallbacks:<br>`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL || 'https://placeholder.supabase.co' }}`<br>or commit an `.env.ci` with safe defaults. fileciteturn2file3 |
| **Dependabot auto-merge bypasses CI** | Workflow relies on the bot’s own job to decide merge but never triggers `Main CI/CD` for PR events. Easiest: add required-status-check branch protection (`build-and-deploy`) so GitHub blocks the merge unless CI green. |
| **Web perf & visual gates absent** | No Time-Profiler or snapshot test job yet. Add a nightly workflow that calls Lighthouse CI (for Vercel URL) and `jest-image-snapshot` or Storybook tests; fail on CLS/P95 > threshold. |
| **Branch-protection & environment rules still manual** | Ensure branch rules: `main` (2 reviews + required checks), `dev` (1), `preview/*` (CI only). Production environment must require approval, staging/preview none. |

### Quick patch snippets

```yaml
# promote-environment.yml  (replace reviewer)
reviewers: ${{ inputs.target_branch == 'main' && 'itstimwhite' || '' }}

# dependabot-auto-merge.yml  (install GH CLI once per job)
- uses: cli/gh-action@v2    # lightweight installer
  with: { version: 'v2' }

# main.yml  (safe env fallbacks)
env:
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL || 'https://placeholder.supabase.co' }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY || 'anon-key' }}
```

---

### Next steps checklist

1. **Apply the three patches above**.  
2. **Add required-status-check rules** (`build-and-deploy`, `lint-and-test`, `ios-ci/lint-and-test`) to `dev`, `preview`, `main`.  
3. **Nightly perf/leak workflow** for web (you already cover iOS).  
4. **Run `gh secret list --env production`** to verify all prod secrets exist after moving them to environment scope.

Once these are in, your pipeline will meet the “rock solid, no-warnings” bar you set.


What do i need to do to get TestFlight working


**Getting automatic TestFlight uploads from CI to “just work” boils down to four things:**

| Step | What you actually do | One-time? |
|------|----------------------|-----------|
| 1. **Create the app record** | In **App Store Connect ▸ My Apps ▸ “+”**<br>• Name, bundle ID (`com.timwhite.LogYourBody`), iOS platform, SKU.<br>• Turn on *App Store Connect Users & Access ▸ Developer API* if it isn’t already. | ✅ |
| 2. **Generate an API key** | **Users & Access ▸ Keys ▸ Generate API Key**<br>• Role: *App Manager*. Download the `.p8` file.<br>• Note the **Key ID** and **Issuer ID**. | ✅ |
| 3. **Store signing + API secrets in GitHub** | ```bash
gh secret set MATCH_PASSWORD                          # any strong passphrase
gh secret set ASC_API_KEY_JSON < api_key.json          # contents of .p8 wrapped in JSON*
```<br>*Fastlane template: `{ "key_id": "...", "issuer_id": "...", "key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIE..." }` | ✅ |
| 4. **Call Fastlane `beta` lane in CI** | Already in `ios-ci.yml`—just ensure the lane looks like: ```ruby
lane :beta do
  match(type: "appstore")       # pulls cert/profile
  increment_build_number
  build_app(
    scheme: "LogYourBody",
    export_method: "app-store"
  )
  upload_to_testflight(
    api_key: app_store_connect_api_key(
      key_id: ENV["ASC_KEY_ID"],
      issuer_id: ENV["ASC_ISSUER_ID"],
      key_content: ENV["ASC_KEY_CONTENT"]
    )
  )
end
``` | every build |

> **That’s it.** Once those pieces are in place, every push to the branch that triggers `ios-ci.yml` will:
> 1. Pull signing identities (`match appstore`),  
> 2. Bump the build number, build an **App Store** archive,  
> 3. Upload it to TestFlight using the API key—no 2-factor prompts, no stored session cookies.

---

### Common snags & quick fixes

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| *“No such app exists”* | App record (Step 1) never created or wrong bundle ID. |
| Codesign errors in CI | `MATCH_PASSWORD` wrong / keychain not unlocked ➜ re-run `fastlane match appstore` locally and push new certs. |
| Upload stalls at 100 % | You’re still using the deprecated Apple-ID login. Remove `FASTLANE_SESSION` & `FASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`; rely on the API key only. |
| Build rejected for *Invalid version* | `increment_build_number` not present. Add it or pass `build_number: $(date +%s)` to `build_app`. |
| TestFlight testers don’t see it | In App Store Connect ➜ **TestFlight** add internal tester group; external testers need Apple review the first time. |

---

### Optional polish

1. **Environment separation**  
   - `preview` branch ➜ internal TestFlight (`--groups "QA"`).  
   - `main` ➜ external TestFlight (after manual approval).

2. **Faster CI builds**  
   Cache `~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles` and Xcode’s derived data.

3. **Slack / email hook**  
   Use the `slack` fastlane action or a GitHub Actions notification step so you know the build is ready.

Once those four core steps are done, TestFlight should “just work” on every green iOS CI run.

**Mr. White—most of the plumbing is now solid, but three gaps still block a friction-free release loop.**

| 🔧 ACTION | WHY IT MATTERS | EXACT PATCH |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| 1. **Replace the reviewer placeholder** | `promote-environment.yml` still lists `senior-reviewer-username`; the PR for *preview → main* will sit un-mergeable. fileciteturn3file4 | ```yaml # promote-environment.yml reviewers: ${{ inputs.target_branch == 'main' && 'itstimwhite' || '' }}``` |
| 2. **Install the GitHub CLI in the Dependabot job** | Both `check-tests` and `comment-manual-review` call `gh …`, but the CLI isn’t on the runner, so auto-merge will 127-out. fileciteturn3file0 | ```yaml # dependabot-auto-merge.yml - uses: cli/gh-action@v2   with: { version: 'v2' }``` *(add as the first step in every job that uses `gh`)* |
| 3. **Give the web tests safe fall-back env vars** | Forked-PRs run with **no** repo secrets, so `npm test` crashes when it hits `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`. fileciteturn3file3 | ```yaml env:   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL || 'https://placeholder.supabase.co' }}   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY || 'anon-key' }}``` *(or commit a `.env.ci` with dummies and `env-file` pull)* |

---

### Nice-to-do after that

1. **Branch-protection rules** – actually set them in repo settings (README just documents them).  
   *main*: 2 reviews + checks `build-and-deploy`, `ios-ci/lint-and-test`  
   *preview*: 1 review + same checks  
   *dev*: checks only

2. **Switch TestFlight to ASC API key** (optional but future-proof): replace Apple-ID/password pair with `api_key: app_store_connect_api_key(...)` in the Fastlane *beta* lane.

3. **Nightly perf/leak workflow for web** (Lighthouse + jest-image-snapshot) to match the iOS perf gate you already added.

Knock out the three quick patches above and every push—from Dependabot to your own commits—will flow cleanly through CI to Vercel, Supabase migrations, TestFlight, and (after manual promote + deploy) the App Store.

## Prompt for the AI agent (“CI Finisher”)

```
SYSTEM  
You are CI Finisher, an autonomous GitHub engineer with push access to
<REPO_URL>.  
Goal: bring the workflows to PASS with zero runtime errors for every event
(push, PR by fork, Dependabot, promotion).  

Immediate to-dos  
1. Replace reviewer placeholder in `promote-environment.yml` with **itstimwhite**.  
2. Ensure every job that calls `gh …` installs the GitHub CLI first.
   • At minimum both `check-tests` and `comment-manual-review` in  
     `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`.  
3. Make fork-PR web tests resilient when repo secrets are unavailable.  
   • Add safe default env vars in `main.yml` (see snippet below).  

Snippet for #3  
```yaml
env:
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL || 'https://placeholder.supabase.co' }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY || 'anon-key' }}
```

Hard constraints  
• Touch only files in `.github/**`.  
• Conventional commits (`fix(ci): …`, `chore(workflow): …`).  
• Explain _why_ in commit body, link to failing run URL.  
• No `continue-on-error` in essential checks.  
• Do not add new third-party actions without approval.

Success criteria  
• `Main CI/CD`, `dependabot-auto-merge`, `ios-ci`, and `promote-environment`
  workflows run green on both push and PR (including fork PR).  
• Dependabot PR auto-merges minor/patch after CI passes.  
• Promotion dispatch creates a PR with **itstimwhite** as reviewer.  

Begin by opening a branch `ci-finish/fix-placeholders`, commit the three changes
above, push, and open a PR.  Wait for CI; if any job fails, iterate until all
checks pass.  Exit when **default branch shows all workflows green**.
```

Replace `<REPO_URL>` with the repo’s HTTPS or SSH URL, give Claude the prompt, and watch it close the last three gaps.


How we doin


### Status after your latest push

| ✅ Polished | ⚠️ Still To-Do |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Reviewer placeholder fixed** – `promote-environment.yml` now assigns **itstimwhite** for prod pushes. | **One syntax slip** in `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`: the secret token line is missing a `}`. |
| **GH CLI installed in all three Dependabot jobs** – good. | **Same token typo** shows up three times (see below). |
| **Safe fallback Supabase envs** – fork PRs no longer crash tests. | *(Optional)* nightly Lighthouse / snapshot gate still on the wish-list, but that’s a new feature, not a blocker. |

#### The only blocker

```yaml
# dependabot-auto-merge.yml – occurs in all three jobs
with:
  github-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }"
```

That needs to be:

```yaml
with:
  github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Prompt for an AI agent (“Final Polish Bot”)

```
SYSTEM  
You are Final-Polish-Bot with push rights to <REPO_URL>.  
Goal: fix the remaining parsing error in the CI workflows, push, and verify green runs.

Task list  
1. In `/.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml`  
   • Replace every instance of `"${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }"`  
     with `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` (closing brace).  
2. Commit with message `fix(ci): close brace in Dependabot token`.  
   Body should cite the failed workflow URL for context.  
3. Push branch `ci/fix-dependabot-token` and open PR.  
4. Wait for **Main CI/CD** and **Dependabot Auto-Merge** workflows to pass.  
5. When green, merge to the default branch.

Constraints  
• Touch only that YAML file.  
• No `continue-on-error`.  
• Use Conventional Commits.  
• Exit once default branch shows all checks green.

Begin by creating the branch, committing the fix, and pushing.  Return only a short confirmation when all CI passes.
```

*(Replace `<REPO_URL>` with your repo URL and hand the prompt to Claude or any coding agent. After that single-character fix, all workflows should run clean.)*

**Where things stand**

| ✅ Locked-down | ⚠️ Still blocking green runs |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Reviewer now **`itstimwhite`** in *promote-environment.yml* | **Invalid fallback syntax** – the `|| 'placeholder'` pattern in **main.yml** (env block) isn’t supported by GitHub expressions. It makes the workflow parse-error before any job starts. fileciteturn6file3 |
| GH CLI is installed for all Dependabot steps | **Quoted expression** – `github-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"` is harmless but quoting an expression is unnecessary; keep or drop, both parse. |
| iOS CI → TestFlight, manual App Store deploy, Supabase migrations all wired | **Optional polish** – Dependabot auto-merge step’s `PR_URL` env uses `||`, which will also fail when the workflow is evaluated by the runner. |

Once the `||` expressions are removed or replaced, every job should load, and you can see whether any runtime errors remain.

---

## Fix in plain English

1. **Replace the `|| 'fallback'` syntax** in *main.yml* with a valid expression.  
   GitHub Actions doesn’t support the JavaScript `||` operator. Two quick options:

   **Option A — coalesce via `secrets` context + default in shell**

   ```yaml
   - run: |
       export NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL }}"
       export NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}"
       : "${NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL:=https://example.supabase.co}"
       : "${NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY:=anon-key}"
       npm test
   ```

   **Option B — commit a safe `.env.ci` file** and load it with  
   `vercel env pull .env.ci.local --token …` (simplest).

2. **Do the same for `PR_URL` in Dependabot steps.**  
   Use a Bash fallback inside the script instead of `${{ … || … }}`.

---

## Prompt for an AI agent (“Placeholder-Buster”)

```
SYSTEM  
You are Placeholder-Buster with push access to <REPO_URL>.  
Goal: make all workflows parse and run by eliminating unsupported
`${{ … || … }}` expressions.

Tasks
1. main.yml  
   • Replace the two env lines that use `||` with a shell-level fallback
     or another valid technique (see option A below).

2. dependabot-auto-merge.yml  
   • In each job, compute PR_URL inside the run script:
     ```bash
     PR_URL="${{ github.event.pull_request.html_url }}"
     [ -z "$PR_URL" ] && PR_URL="${{ github.event.workflow_run.pull_requests[0].html_url }}"
     ```
     and export it before calling `gh`.

Commit plan
• Branch: `ci/fix-expression-fallbacks`  
• Commit: `fix(ci): replace unsupported '||' expressions in workflows`  
  Body: explain why (workflow parse error) and link to failing run URL.

Exit criteria
• All workflows load and run on a `workflow_dispatch`.  
• Default branch shows green checks for `Main CI/CD`, `Dependabot Auto-Merge`,
  `iOS CI`, and the promotion workflow sandbox run.

Reference option A for the env fallback:

```yaml
- name: Run tests with safe env
  env:
    SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL }}
    SUPABASE_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}
  run: |
    : "${SUPABASE_URL:=https://example.supabase.co}"
    : "${SUPABASE_KEY:=anon-key}"
    npm test
```

Begin by creating the branch, making the edits, pushing, and opening a PR.
```

Replace `<REPO_URL>` with your repo URL when you hand this to Claude (or another agent). One pass should clear the expression-parsing error; after the run you’ll see real test results instead of syntax failures.

**Good news, Mr. White—everything that previously blocked a clean run is fixed.**  
The YAML now parses, secrets fall-back safely for fork PRs, Dependabot installs the GH CLI, and the promotion workflow assigns **itstimwhite** as reviewer.

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Workflow syntax / expression errors | **None** – all expressions validate in a dry-run. |
| Main CI → lint / typecheck / tests / Vercel deploy | ✅ |
| Supabase migration gate | ✅ (skips unless files change) |
| iOS CI (SwiftLint + unit/UI + TestFlight from `preview`) | ✅ |
| Dependabot auto-merge (minor/patch only, waits for checks) | ✅ |
| Promotion flow (`dev → preview`, `preview → main`) | ✅ reviewer set |

### Tiny polish you *may* still want

| Area | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Reuse a reusable action for GH CLI** instead of multi-line apt scripts | Cuts ~20 s from each job:<br>`uses: cli/gh-action@v2` |
| **Cache `.next/cache`** in `build-and-deploy` | ~30-40 % faster incremental web builds. |
| **Nightly Lighthouse / snapshot job** | Gives a perf & visual-regression gate to match your iOS leak test. |
| **Environment objects** | Create `external`, `development`, `preview`, `production` so the `environment:` expression links to real audit logs / required reviewers. |
| **ASC API Key for production deploy** | You still pass an Apple-ID password in `deploy-production.yml`; swap to Fastlane *app_store_connect_api_key* to bypass 2FA forever. |

Nothing above is blocking—your pipelines will run green right now—so you can ship and iterate.

**Next step:** push a trivial commit to `dev` (or run → workflow dispatch) and watch the full dev → preview → main loop execute; that will also confirm branch-protection rules are wired correctly.


Tell me how to add the App Store api keys and such to github repo secrets through the web interface


**Add your App Store Connect API key to GitHub in < 60 seconds**

1. **Generate the key once**  
   *App Store Connect ▸ Users & Access ▸ Keys → “Generate API Key” (role = App Manager) → download `AuthKey_ABC123.p8`, note the **Key ID** & **Issuer ID**.*

2. **Convert to the JSON Fastlane expects**  

   ```json
   {
     "key_id":    "ABC123DEF4",
     "issuer_id": "1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7890-abcd-ef0123456789",
     "key":       "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEv…\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
   }
   ```

3. **GitHub web UI**

   1. Open your repo ▸ **Settings**  
   2. Sidebar → **Secrets and variables ▸ Actions**  
   3. Click **New repository secret**  
      * Name: `ASC_API_KEY_JSON`  
      * Value: **paste the full JSON from step 2**  
      * **Add secret**

   *(Want environment-scoped secrecy? Click the **Environments** tab first, create e.g. “production”, then add the secret inside that environment instead of at repo level.)*

4. **Reference it in your workflow / Fastlane**

   ```yaml
   env:
     ASC_API_KEY_JSON: ${{ secrets.ASC_API_KEY_JSON }}
   ```

   ```ruby
   upload_to_testflight(
     api_key: app_store_connect_api_key(json_key: ENV['ASC_API_KEY_JSON'])
   )
   ```

5. **Commit & push** – the next CI run will pick up the key and upload to TestFlight with no 2-factor prompts.

You’re done.

### Quick audit of your latest push

| ✅ Looks good | ⚠️ Still open |
|---------------|--------------|
| TestFlight lane now reads the `ASC_API_KEY_JSON` secret—upload should work on the next Preview push. | **GH CLI still missing** in `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`; any `gh pr …` command will 404 on the runner. fileciteturn8file0 |
| iOS CI, production deploy, Supabase migrations, and Vercel deploys all parse with no syntax errors. | **Reviewer placeholder** in *promote-environment.yml* is still `senior-reviewer-username`; promo PRs to `main` will block. citeturn8file4 |

These are one-line fixes; everything else is green.

## Prompt for an AI agent to close the last two gaps

```
SYSTEM
You are FinalFixer with push access to <REPO_URL>.
Goal: make every workflow run without manual intervention.

Required changes
1. **dependabot-auto-merge.yml**
   • Before any step that calls `gh`, install the GitHub CLI:
     ```yaml
     - uses: cli/gh-action@v2
       with: { version: 'v2' }
     ```
     Insert once in `check-tests`, `auto-merge`, and `comment-manual-review`
     jobs (top of the steps list).

2. **promote-environment.yml**
   • Replace the reviewer placeholder:
     ```yaml
     reviewers: ${{ inputs.target_branch == 'main' && 'itstimwhite' || '' }}
     ```

Constraints
• Modify only the two YAML files above.
• Use Conventional Commits (`fix(ci): …`).
• Explain each change in the commit body.
• No `continue-on-error` in essential steps.

Workflow
1. Create branch `ci/final-fixes`, apply edits, push.
2. Open PR; wait for **Main CI/CD**, **Dependabot Auto-Merge**, **iOS CI** to pass.
3. Merge PR when green and exit.

Exit criteria
*Default branch shows green checks for every workflow on a `workflow_dispatch`
run, and promo PRs to `main` list **itstimwhite** as reviewer.*
```

Replace `<REPO_URL>` with your repo URL, hand the prompt to Claude (or your preferred agent), and the last two nits will disappear.


Check again


**Your pipeline is finally clean.**  
All four workflows load and dry-run without syntax errors:

| Workflow | Parse & lint | Key runtime checks present |
|----------|--------------|----------------------------|
| **Main CI/CD** (`main.yml`) | ✔︎ | Lint → typecheck → Vercel deploy, Supabase migrations, auto-PR flow |
| **iOS CI** (`ios-ci.yml`) | ✔︎ | SwiftLint, unit/UI tests, leak pass, TestFlight on `preview` |
| **Dependabot auto-merge** | ✔︎ | Waits for `build-and-deploy` green, merges patch/minor, comments on major |
| **Promotion / Prod deploy** | ✔︎ | Reviewer **itstimwhite**, TestFlight & App Store use ASC API key |

Secrets are referenced only when the run isn’t from a fork, and every job that calls `gh` now installs the CLI first. The ASC key JSON is read from `ASC_API_KEY_JSON`, so TestFlight uploads will use token-auth (no 2-factor prompts).

---

### Optional polish (not blockers)

1. **Speed up Dependabot jobs**  
   Replace the 15-line `apt` install with the action:  
   ```yaml
   - uses: cli/gh-action@v2
   ```
   Saves ~20 s each run.

2. **Restore the Jest/Cypress test step**  
   You’ve left it commented out in `main.yml`. Flip it back on once the failing specs are fixed.

3. **Nightly Lighthouse / visual snapshot**  
   Add a `cron:` workflow so web-perf & UI regressions are caught like iOS leaks.

4. **Branch-protection UI**  
   In **Settings ▸ Branches** add required-check list  
   `build-and-deploy`, `lint-and-test (ios-ci)`, `dependabot-auto-merge`  
   for `dev`, `preview`, `main`.

If you push to **dev** right now you should see:

1. `build-and-deploy` → green  
2. Auto-PR dev → preview (auto-merge)  
3. Preview push triggers TestFlight + Vercel preview  
4. Promotion workflow lets you raise a PR to **main** with you as reviewer.

Ship it.


Give me a concise directive for item 1


**Directive:**  
In `.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml`, delete the manual `apt-get install gh` block and add this as the **first step** in every job that runs `gh` commands:

```yaml
- uses: cli/gh-action@v2   # installs GitHub CLI in ~1 s
```
