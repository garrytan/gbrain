 Codex 5.1 vs Claude sonnet 4.5

## Assistant

Short answer, Mr. White: they’re in the *same tier*, but tuned for slightly different sweet spots.

You’re basically comparing:

- **Codex 5.1 = `gpt-5.1-codex`** – OpenAI’s GPT-5.1 variant optimized for **long-running, agentic coding tasks** (the “coding workhorse” behind Codex-style workflows and Copilot previews). citeturn1search0turn1search2turn0search17  
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** – Anthropic’s flagship “Sonnet” model, marketed as **best in the world for coding, complex agents and computer use**, with big gains in reasoning/math and long-horizon autonomy. citeturn1search1turn1search3turn0news3turn1search6

### 1. Coding strength

**Claude Sonnet 4.5**

- Anthropic explicitly pitches it as *“the best coding model in the world”* and their strongest model for agents and computer use. citeturn1search1turn1search3  
- On SWE-bench and related benchmarks, Sonnet 4.5 is currently at or near the top (around 70–77% on SWE-bench Verified depending on setup), and also very strong on OSWorld for real computer use. citeturn1search4turn1search10turn1search14  

**Codex 5.1 (`gpt-5.1-codex`)**

- Officially described as optimized for **long-running, agentic coding tasks in Codex-like environments**, building on GPT-5 and GPT-5.1. citeturn1search0turn1search2turn1search11  
- GPT-5 Codex (previous gen) was already right behind top Claude models on SWE-bench; 5.1 Codex is the new iteration, but public, apples-to-apples benchmarks are still sparse as of mid-November 2025. citeturn1search4turn1search10turn0search22  

**Reality check:**  
In practice, for repo-scale coding, tests, refactors, etc., both are **extremely strong**. Sonnet 4.5 currently has a slight edge on *public* coding benchmarks; Codex 5.1 is tuned specifically for OpenAI’s Codex/agent harness and may feel stronger inside that ecosystem than raw benchmarks suggest.

### 2. Agents, tool use & long-horizon work

**Claude Sonnet 4.5**

- Designed for **complex agents and long-running autonomy**, with claims of handling up to ~30 hours of continuous autonomous work and strong real-world computer use (desktop tool control, multi-app workflows). citeturn0news3turn1search6turn1news36  
- Exposed controls for “how long it thinks” and good at visible step-by-step reasoning in “thinking” modes. citeturn1search3  

**Codex 5.1**

- Official docs frame `gpt-5.1-codex` as **optimized for longer-running, agentic coding tasks** within Codex or Codex-like environments – so more about large coding jobs and planning/execution loops than GUI automation. citeturn1search0turn1search2turn1search8  
- Deep integration with GitHub Copilot’s new previews and OpenAI’s own agent tooling. citeturn0search17turn0search11turn1news30  

**Net:**  
- **Sonnet 4.5**: currently better documented for “full-desktop” agents and multi-app workflows.  
- **Codex 5.1**: specializes in **code-centric agents** (repos, tests, refactors) tightly bound to OpenAI/Copilot infrastructure.

---

### 3. Ecosystem & ergonomics

- **Codex 5.1**
  - Best fit if you’re already deep in **GitHub Copilot / VS Code / OpenAI API** and want one stack: GPT-5.1 for general tasks, `gpt-5.1-codex` for heavy coding/agents. citeturn0search17turn1search0turn1search11  

- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**
  - Available in **Claude.ai**, Claude API, and Amazon Bedrock (including GovCloud), pitched hard for enterprise agents, coding and security workflows. citeturn1search1turn1search3turn1search6turn0search6  

Pricing for both is in the same general ballpark and changes often; you really have to check their current pricing pages for exact numbers.

### 4. How I’d choose, pragmatically

If we strip away marketing and just look at how you’d *use* them:

- **Heavy repo work + Copilot / OpenAI stack → start with Codex 5.1.**  
  You’ll get tighter integration, better tooling, and fewer glue layers.

- **Long-running multi-app agents, complex workflows, or you like Claude’s “feel” → Sonnet 4.5.**  
  It currently edges ahead on public coding/computer-use benchmarks and is explicitly designed for those 10–30-hour autonomous jobs.

- **General chat + coding**: both are overkill and excellent. Choice comes down to which ecosystem you’re already in (OpenAI vs Anthropic/Bedrock).

If you tell me your actual workflow (IDE, languages, whether you want real desktop agents or just repo-level help), I can be very concrete about which one makes more sense for you.
