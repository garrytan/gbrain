Hey, so my dev setup is running Conductor on a 2022 MacBook Air, 16 gigabytes of RAM, one terabyte hard drive, 200 gigabytes free storage on it right now. And I use that with Gary Tan's GStack. It's a public repo. And that's what I'm doing. And I'm running one, two, three, four, five parallel agents right now. And my computer is struggling pretty hard with that. Like, and it's pretty impossible to run dev servers at the same time. So I'm wanting to, I'm considering getting another machine, but we don't have the runway right now to buy another MacBook Pro with like one of the M5 chips. So I'm considering if it's worth it to like, just to get us on bottlenecked for another month or two of shipping to buy like a Mac Mini and set that up, and then have the Mac Mini running 24 seven with Conductor. And then I can do a lot of the like, tasks I need to do where it kind of autonomously does like Q&A research and stuff and bug fixing and stuff, and have those running in parallel on the Mac Mini. Is that gonna buy me enough bandwidth and like, what are the current ones and do they have M5 Pro or M5 Max ones, or are those coming out in the fall or like, what's the deal?

## Assistant

Mr. White,

Yes. A dedicated Mac mini should buy you real bandwidth for the next month or two. As of March 16, 2026, Apple is selling the Mac mini only in M4 and M4 Pro versions. The line starts at $599, and current M4 Pro configurations start at $1,399. Apple did announce M5 MacBook Air and M5 Pro/M5 Max MacBook Pro on March 3, 2026, but it has not announced any M5 Mac mini. citeturn942059search7turn942059search0turn346562view3turn346562view4

On the M5 question: there is no Apple-confirmed date. The best public reporting says refreshed Mac mini models are on Apple’s 2026 roadmap, with reporting pointing to M5 and M5 Pro variants later this year. I would not plan around a fall release, because the public signal is still vague. I also do not see credible reporting pointing to an M5 Max Mac mini; the rumor coverage is centered on M5 and M5 Pro. citeturn346562view11turn378475search2turn378475search1

Your current machine is the exact kind of Mac that will get crushed by this workload. Apple’s 2022 MacBook Air uses M2 with an 8-core CPU and 100GB/s memory bandwidth, and Apple describes that model as fanless. Conductor is built to run multiple coding agents in isolated workspaces, and it can also launch dev servers and tests from the UI. Five parallel agents plus dev servers is a heavy sustained CPU-and-memory load for a 16GB fanless Air. citeturn845327search0turn231268search0turn346562view6turn346562view7turn346562view9

For your use case, I would skip the plain M4 mini. The base M4 mini is a 10-core CPU part with 120GB/s memory bandwidth and tops out at 32GB unified memory. The M4 Pro mini starts at 12 CPU cores and 16 GPU cores with 273GB/s memory bandwidth, and it can be configured with 24GB, 48GB, or 64GB unified memory. That is the tier that plausibly gives you enough headroom for five agents and real dev work at the same time. citeturn460096view0turn460096view1

My recommendation is simple: buy now if the bottleneck is hurting shipping. Get an **M4 Pro Mac mini**. The floor I’d consider is **24GB / 512GB**. The better choice is **48GB** if you want five agents plus browser work, tests, and a dev server without constantly managing memory pressure. I would only buy the plain M4 mini if you are willing to cap parallelism lower. A dedicated box also matches Conductor’s own safety guidance, since its agents run with your user-account permissions and the docs explicitly say a separate machine or VM can be safer. citeturn346562view1turn346562view8

If cash is tight, check Apple’s refurb store before buying new. Apple says its certified refurbished Macs save up to 15% and include a one-year warranty, and there are current refurb Mac mini listings including M4 Pro and M2 Pro models. citeturn835359search5turn835359search9turn835359search0

My blunt answer: **yes, the Mac mini move is worth it, but only if you buy M4 Pro.** Waiting for M5 is a gamble.

## User

I'm willing to spend about two grand, maybe $2,500 max, and even that would be stretching it. Anything in here that we could do with that?

## Assistant

Mr. White,

Yes. With a $2,000 to $2,500 cap, there are workable options right now.

products{"selections":[["turn236086product0","Mac mini M4 16GB / 256GB"],["turn236086product1","Mac mini M4 16GB / 512GB"],["turn236086product3","Mac mini M4 24GB / 512GB"],["turn911500product4","Mac mini M4 32GB / 1TB"],["turn290359product11","Mac mini M4 Pro 24GB / 512GB"],["turn340513product2","Mac mini M4 Pro upgraded config"],["turn236086product7","Mac Studio M4 Max 36GB / 512GB"],["turn884961product0","Mac Studio M4 Max 36GB / 1TB"]],"tags":["Budget floor","Cheap starter","Safer budget","M4 maxed out","Best new value","More headroom","Fastest under $2k","1TB desktop"]}

My recommendation is the **Apple-refurbished Mac mini M4 Pro with 48GB RAM and 512GB SSD at $1,529**. Apple’s refurb page lists that exact config, and Apple says refurb Macs include a one-year warranty. For your workload, the 48GB matters a lot more than squeezing out a little extra SSD space. citeturn171921view0turn381004search13

The **budget floor I’d actually consider new** is the **Mac mini M4 Pro starting at $1,399**. Apple’s M4 Pro platform supports up to **64GB unified memory** and **273GB/s memory bandwidth**; plain M4 tops out at **32GB** and **120GB/s**. For five parallel agents plus dev servers, that gap is meaningful. citeturn381004search3turn694216view4

The **cheap-refurb fallback** is the **Apple-refurbished Mac mini M4 Pro with 24GB RAM and 512GB SSD at $1,359**. I would buy that over any plain-M4 mini for your use case, but 24GB is still a compromise if you want to keep five agents running comfortably. citeturn171921view1turn694216view4

If you want the most raw machine under your ceiling, the **base Mac Studio M4 Max 36GB / 512GB is $1,999**, and the **1TB version is $2,199**. That is within budget today. My read, though, is that your bottleneck sounds more like sustained multi-process memory pressure than GPU horsepower, so I would still lean **48GB M4 Pro mini over 36GB base Mac Studio** unless your workload is especially compile-heavy or GPU-heavy. That last part is an inference from your setup. citeturn468519search0turn468519search3turn694216view1

My ranking for you:

1. **Best overall:** refurb **Mac mini M4 Pro, 48GB / 512GB** at **$1,529**. citeturn171921view0  
2. **Best new:** new **Mac mini M4 Pro, 24GB / 512GB** starting at **$1,399**. citeturn381004search3  
3. **Fastest under budget:** **Mac Studio M4 Max, 36GB / 512GB** at **$1,999**. citeturn468519search0

I would skip the plain M4 mini for this specific use.

That'd be better or worse than getting like an M5 Pro MacBook or something that falls within that budget, or like a Mac Studio or something.

Mr. White,

For your exact use case, a **Mac mini M4 Pro is better than an M5 Pro MacBook Pro**. A **Mac Studio** is only better if you want the strongest fixed desktop and are comfortable spending closer to $2,000. For a dedicated 24/7 Conductor box, I would rank them like this:

**1) Refurb Mac mini M4 Pro 48GB / 512GB — best buy**  
Apple’s refurbished store currently has that config at **$1,529**. M4 Pro supports up to **64GB unified memory** and **273GB/s memory bandwidth**. For running several agents in parallel, that much RAM at this price is the strongest value in the lineup. citeturn503205search3turn453084search6

**2) Mac Studio M4 Max 36GB / 512GB — best raw desktop under budget**  
Apple’s base M4 Max Mac Studio is **$1,999** with **36GB unified memory**. The M4 Max tier has **546GB/s memory bandwidth**, which is materially stronger than M4 Pro. If your workload is constant compiles, tests, containers, and hard sustained CPU/GPU use, Studio is the more serious machine. citeturn855843search2turn453084search2

**3) 14-inch MacBook Pro with M5 Pro — only if it also replaces your laptop**  
Apple says the 14-inch M5 Pro/M5 Max MacBook Pro family starts at **$2,699**, and M5 Pro supports up to **64GB unified memory** with up to **307GB/s memory bandwidth**. Apple also claims M5 Pro delivers up to **30% faster multithreaded performance** than M4 Pro. That is a real step up. But for a machine that will mostly sit on a desk running agents, you are paying for a battery, display, keyboard, and portability you do not need. citeturn855843search3turn453084search11turn453084search13

My practical read:

- If this is a **second machine just for Conductor**, the **mini wins**.
- If you want the **strongest always-on desktop** you can justify, the **Studio wins**.
- If you want **one machine that replaces your current Air and also serves as the agent box**, then the **M5 Pro MacBook Pro** is the right category, but it is the weakest value per dollar for this specific job. citeturn503205search3turn855843search2turn855843search3

The key tradeoff is simple:

- **Mac mini M4 Pro refurb 48GB**: best throughput per dollar for multi-agent work.
- **Mac Studio M4 Max 36GB**: more brute force, less RAM than that refurb mini config, higher cost.
- **MacBook Pro M5 Pro**: fastest laptop option, worst value as a headless worker node. citeturn503205search3turn855843search2turn453084search11

My recommendation: **buy the refurb M4 Pro Mac mini with 48GB** unless you also want this purchase to replace your everyday laptop. If you do want one machine to do both, then step up to the MacBook Pro and accept that you are paying a portability premium.

What mbp?

## Assistant

Mr. White,

I meant the **14-inch MacBook Pro with M5 Pro**. Apple lists it starting at **$2,199**, and the base M5 Pro config is **24GB unified memory and 1TB SSD**. The **16-inch M5 Pro** starts at **$2,699**, which is above the budget you gave. citeturn724104search0turn724104search1turn724104search3

There is also a **14-inch MacBook Pro with plain M5** starting at **$1,699**, but that is a different machine from the M5 Pro model I was referring to. Apple’s lineup for the 14-inch model includes **M5, M5 Pro, and M5 Max**. citeturn724104search1turn724104search10

For your use case, the direct comparison is:

- **14-inch MBP M5 Pro** at **$2,199** if you want one machine that is both your laptop and your worker box. citeturn724104search0turn724104search3
- **Mac mini M4 Pro refurb with 48GB RAM** if you want the best dedicated Conductor machine per dollar; that gives you more RAM headroom for multi-agent work than the base M5 Pro laptop at a much lower price. citeturn724104search1turn724104search0

So when I said “MBP,” I meant **the 14-inch M5 Pro MacBook Pro, not the plain M5 model**.

## User

And if I go mini is there a superfast Remote Desktop I could use over LaN and wan? To run agents from the laptop to go on the Mac desktop?

---

## Assistant

Mr. White,

Yes. The cleanest answer is:

**Best overall setup:** **Tailscale + Jump Desktop**.  
That gives you easy WAN access without opening your Mac mini to the public internet, and Jump Desktop is built for remote access to a Mac from anywhere. Tailscale’s current Personal plan is free for up to 3 users and 100 devices, and its docs explicitly position it for SSH, VNC, and other remote-access use cases. Jump Desktop’s Mac setup uses the free **Jump Desktop Connect** app on the remote machine. citeturn346438search0turn346438search3turn346438search7turn252729search19

For **LAN only**, Apple’s own **Screen Sharing** is the cheapest answer because it is built in, and Apple now supports **High Performance** screen sharing between two Apple silicon Macs on macOS Sonoma 14 or later. Apple says wired networking is recommended, both Macs must be Apple silicon, and for a single 4K display it recommends about **75 Mbps** with low latency. citeturn369927search6turn222840search2turn222840search14

My practical ranking for your use case:

1. **Tailscale + Jump Desktop** — best mix of speed, ease, and WAN reliability. citeturn346438search0turn346438search3turn252729search19  
2. **Apple Screen Sharing on LAN** — free and very good inside the house or office, especially Mac-to-Mac. citeturn369927search6turn222840search2  
3. **Tailscale + RustDesk** — good lower-cost/open option if you want something more self-hostable. RustDesk supports macOS, and Tailscale has an official guide for using RustDesk over a tailnet. citeturn869103search3turn869103search7turn222840search8

For actually **running agents**, I would split it like this:

- Use **SSH / Tailscale SSH** for starting jobs, tailing logs, restarting services, and managing workspaces. That is lighter and more reliable than living inside a remote GUI all day. Apple supports built-in **Remote Login** for SSH, and Tailscale has a built-in SSH feature. citeturn228850search0turn869103search10  
- Use **remote desktop only when you need the Mac desktop** for Conductor UI, browser-based debugging, or checking a dev server visually. citeturn228850search1turn346438search0

So the setup I would actually buy into is:

**Mac mini + Ethernet + Tailscale + Jump Desktop + SSH enabled.**  
That will let your laptop act like the control surface while the mini does the heavy lifting. On LAN, Apple Screen Sharing may already be enough. On WAN, Jump Desktop is the one I would trust first for a smoother experience. citeturn222840search2turn346438search0turn228850search0

One caution: if you want Apple’s **High Performance** Screen Sharing mode, Apple says only **one** High Performance session can be active per Mac, and both machines need to communicate over **UDP 5900–5902**. citeturn222840search2turn222840search12

My blunt recommendation: **yes, do it, and use Tailscale + Jump Desktop.** Use SSH for the boring stuff and remote desktop for the visual stuff.

Cheapest laptop I could get with 48gb or more of ram?

## Assistant

Mr. White,

The **cheapest new laptop I found, full stop, with 48GB or more RAM** is a **Target-listed HP Essential 255 G10 with 64GB RAM and 1TB SSD at $899.99**, but it was **out of stock** when indexed. A currently listed cheap option is the **HP Essential 17t-cn300 with 64GB RAM and 2TB SSD at $1,149.99**. Those are bargain Windows machines, not the class of laptop I would choose as a direct stand-in for a Mac dev box. citeturn770813search8turn770813search1turn770813search9

If you mean **the cheapest Mac laptop**, the floor I found is a **14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro, 48GB unified memory, and 512GB SSD for $2,039.99 at Micro Center**. A more broadly available shipped option is **B&H’s 14-inch M4 Pro / 48GB / 512GB at $2,399**. The cheapest **M5 Pro** laptop config I found with **48GB** was a **14-inch MacBook Pro M5 Pro / 48GB / 1TB at $2,599**. citeturn796468search3turn810703view0turn796468search4

My practical answer: for **your** workflow, the real floor is the **14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro with 48GB**. It keeps you on macOS, stays compatible with the setup you already have, and lands just above your stretch budget if you catch the Micro Center in-store pricing. From what I found, **there is no new Apple laptop with 48GB under $2,000** right now. citeturn796468search3turn810703view0

What about a MacBook Air the new 151 with 32 GB around

---

## Assistant

Mr. White,

Yes. A **new 15-inch MacBook Air with 32GB** is a legitimate option. Apple’s current 15-inch MacBook Air line supports **16GB, 24GB, or 32GB** of unified memory, and Apple has live 15-inch M5 purchase pages for **32GB/512GB** and **32GB/1TB** configs. The M5 in MacBook Air has **153GB/s** memory bandwidth. citeturn925589search0turn886186search0turn824030search1

My read for your workload:

- **15-inch Air 32GB**: good **if you want one portable machine** and you can accept that it tops out at **32GB**. It will be a meaningful step up from your current 16GB Air.  
- **Mac mini M4 Pro**: still the better buy **if the goal is maximum Conductor throughput per dollar**. Apple’s M4 Pro Mac mini supports **up to 64GB unified memory** and **273GB/s memory bandwidth**, which is a materially better fit for multiple parallel agents and dev-server overhead. citeturn824030search2turn824030search3turn824030search10

So the answer is:

- **Better as your only machine:** **15-inch MacBook Air M5 with 32GB**
- **Better as a dedicated agent box:** **Mac mini M4 Pro**
- **Best raw desktop under your ceiling:** **Mac Studio M4 Max**
- **Best laptop if you want more headroom than Air:** **14-inch MacBook Pro** citeturn145608search1turn317721view4

I would frame it this way:

- Buy the **15-inch Air 32GB** if portability matters every day.
- Buy the **mini M4 Pro** if shipping speed matters more than portability.
- I would **not** choose the Air as a 24/7 worker node over the mini. The Air’s hard ceiling is **32GB**, while the mini M4 Pro goes much higher and has much more memory bandwidth. citeturn925589search0turn824030search3turn824030search13

For you personally, I would rank them:

1. **Mac mini M4 Pro 48GB**  
2. **15-inch MacBook Air M5 32GB**  
3. **14-inch MacBook Pro**  
4. **Plain M4 mini**  

The Air is reasonable. The mini is still the smarter machine for this exact job.

What if I buy the 32 gigabyte Air as my daily driver, sell my existing M2, and then use that to do a dedicated desktop box for the rest?

## Assistant

Mr. White,

Yes. Structurally, that is a good plan.

The Air becomes your human machine. The desktop becomes the worker node. That is a cleaner split than trying to make one fanless laptop do both. Apple says the new 15-inch MacBook Air with M5 is a silent fanless design, supports up to 32GB unified memory, and has 153GB/s memory bandwidth. Apple also says the 15-inch model starts at $1,299, and current pricing breakdowns for Apple’s RAM upgrades put a 15-inch 32GB/512GB config at about $1,699. citeturn262179view0turn643449search4

The budget math is the important part. A 2022 13-inch M2 MacBook Air is currently around **$628 average** on Swappa, with a **$511 low-end current price**. Apple also notes trade-in values can vary after inspection and in-store values can differ from online estimates. So private sale is usually the better path if you need the most dollars back. citeturn409382search3turn886583view4

On the desktop side, Apple’s refurb store currently shows an **M4 Pro Mac mini 24GB/512GB at $1,189** and an **M4 Pro Mac mini higher-memory config at $1,529**. Apple also says M4 Pro on Mac mini supports up to **64GB unified memory** and **273GB/s memory bandwidth**. Base Mac Studio with M4 Max starts with **36GB unified memory**, and Apple’s technical specs list **546GB/s memory bandwidth** for M4 Max. citeturn408030search9turn408030search0turn900890search6turn900890search2turn900890search5

Buy the **15-inch Air 32GB** for your daily machine, sell the M2 privately, and pair it with a **refurb M4 Pro Mac mini 24GB/512GB**. That fits your budget on a net basis and gives you a proper separation between portable work and background agent load. citeturn643449search4turn408030search9turn409382search3turn409472calculator0

**Best technical version:**  
Air 32GB + **mini 48GB**. That is the version I like most for five parallel agents plus dev-server overhead, but it misses your budget. citeturn408030search0turn900890search6

**What I would avoid:**  
Air 32GB + Mac Studio. You are paying too much for this stage of the company unless your workload is much more compile-heavy, GPU-heavy, or media-heavy than what you described. Apple positions Mac Studio as the more extreme pro desktop tier, and its price lands well above the mini path. citeturn900890search2turn459063search3

The one catch is cash flow. Your **net** cost can fit. Your **up-front** outlay does not, unless you sell the M2 first or can float the temporary gap.

My blunt answer: **yes, this is a smart two-machine plan, and the version that actually makes sense is Air 32GB + refurb M4 Pro mini 24GB.** The 48GB mini is the better machine. The 24GB mini is the one that matches your runway.

I can also map the exact buy order that minimizes cash pain.

So, if we get a 15-inch MacBook Air, it would be like with 32 gig and a terabyte drive, it would be like two grand, just shy of like $1,900 before taxes. Is that sufficient? Are we suffering because it's fanless? Are we suffering because the memory throughput is lower? How much is that gonna bottleneck us? And then realistically, like, how many parallel agents do we think we could fire at once?

Mr. White,

A 15-inch MacBook Air with M5, 32GB RAM, and 1TB storage is **sufficient as a daily driver**. It is **not the machine I would choose if the target is five serious Conductor agents plus dev servers at the same time**. Conductor runs agents in parallel in isolated copies of your codebase, and it can also run multiple dev servers at once, so the load stacks fast. citeturn680087view5turn680087view4turn680087view2

Your current M2 Air is getting hit from three directions. The biggest one is **16GB unified memory**. The second is **fanless sustained-load behavior**. The third is **memory bandwidth**. Your current M2 Air has an 8-core CPU and 100GB/s memory bandwidth. The M5 Air moves to a 10-core CPU, 32GB max unified memory, and 153GB/s bandwidth. That is a real upgrade. It should feel materially better than your current machine. citeturn203018search0turn179899search0turn680087view2turn240022view0

The fanless part does matter. Apple’s Air line is fanless, and that is part of why it stays thin and silent. In Notebookcheck’s M5 testing, the 15-inch Air was strong, but it still landed at **962** in Cinebench 2024 multi-core versus **1172** for the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro in the same benchmark. That is about a **22% gap** in one sustained CPU-heavy test, which is a reasonable proxy for the cooling tax you pay on long hot workloads. citeturn179899search0turn680087view0turn870729view2

Memory bandwidth matters, but for your case it is probably **third**. Going from **100GB/s to 153GB/s** helps. Doubling memory from **16GB to 32GB** helps more. The desktop-class gap is still large: the M4 Pro Mac mini offers **273GB/s** bandwidth and up to **64GB** unified memory, with **8 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores** in its base M4 Pro config. That is why the mini is a much better dedicated agent box. citeturn203018search0turn680087view2turn473771view0turn680087view3

My estimate for the **15-inch Air 32GB** is this:

- **2 to 3 parallel agents:** comfortable, with your normal laptop life happening at the same time.
- **4 agents:** realistic if the jobs are lighter and mostly taking turns waiting on model responses.
- **5 agents:** possible in bursts, but I would expect contention, especially once you add a dev server, browser tabs, tests, TypeScript builds, local databases, or Docker.

That estimate is an inference from the hardware specs, the fact that Conductor duplicates workspaces and can run multiple dev servers, and the sustained-load gap between the fanless Air and a cooled MacBook Pro. citeturn680087view5turn680087view4turn680087view0turn870729view2

So the practical answer is:

- **As your only machine:** yes, the 32GB Air is viable.
- **As the thing that unblocks five-agent shipping:** only partially.
- **As a replacement for your current 16GB M2 Air:** absolutely better.
- **As a substitute for a dedicated M4 Pro mini:** no. citeturn680087view2turn473771view0turn680087view3

My blunt recommendation: **plan around 3 serious agents on the Air, treat 4 as stretch, and treat 5 as optimistic.** If your real goal is to keep five running while still using the machine like a normal laptop, the Air will still bottleneck you. The two-machine split remains the better architecture.

## User

My thought is to start get the air and use my existing air in parallel . Then eventually sell the air and get a mini. But basically this is just a bias like enough throughput to get through the next two or three months after we raise we can get like a tricked out. Mac Pro is the Daly driver too and then you know Eric can go to like a second employer or something, but I need to also have a 6 g PC but it’s from 2018 so I don’t know what the band is on it and stuff but the goal is to just get something today that moves us Forward and potentially you know the more the QA stuff and the more hard stuff that that is ongoing I can push off to the PC or the second laptop or something and just leave it in the dock. But how bad does the fanless part hurt me?

---

## Assistant

Mr. White,

The fanless part hurts enough that I would not choose a 15-inch Air as your only heavy worker box. I would still choose it as a better daily driver right now, then use the old Air and the PC as overflow. Conductor runs agents in parallel with isolated copies of your codebase, so RAM use and sustained thermals both matter. The M5 Air goes to 32GB and 153GB/s memory bandwidth; your 2022 M2 Air is 8-core with 100GB/s memory bandwidth. That is a meaningful step up from what you have today. citeturn678401view4turn678401view5turn678401view2

The main win is the jump from 16GB to 32GB. The fanless penalty shows up once jobs stay hot for minutes at a time: builds, tests, indexing, multiple dev servers, local databases, and browser-heavy debugging. Apple’s own power-mode docs say High Power Mode uses extra fan speed for very intensive workloads, and Apple offers that on M5 Pro MacBook Pros and the M4 Pro Mac mini, not on the Air. That is Apple’s own signal that cooling matters under sustained load. citeturn678401view0turn678401view5

My planning number for a 32GB Air is **3 serious parallel agents** while you also use the machine normally. **4** is a stretch target if some agents are lighter or spend a lot of time waiting on model responses. I would not plan around **5 heavy agents plus dev servers** on the Air alone. That estimate is an inference from Conductor’s parallel isolated-workspace model plus the Air’s 32GB ceiling and fanless chassis. citeturn678401view4turn678401view5turn678401view0

For your bridge plan, the new Air + current M2 Air is sensible. I would run the new Air as the main machine, keep **2–3 serious agents** there, and push lower-value ongoing work—QA sweeps, research, long-running checks—to the old Air or the 2018 PC. That should get you through the next 2–3 months a lot better than trying to force everything through one 16GB fanless machine. A cooled M4 Pro mini still gives more sustained headroom because it goes up to 64GB and 273GB/s memory bandwidth. citeturn678401view3turn678401view5turn678401view2

My buy-today answer: **yes, the 15-inch Air with 32GB is sufficient as a bridge.** The fanless tax is real. The 32GB upgrade still moves you forward.

Or an m5 pro with 32gb which is about 2100 pre tax. That’s pushing my budget but possible if you think it’s meaningful better

Mr. White,

Two important points.

The **15-inch MacBook Air M5** is fanless, supports up to **32GB** unified memory, and uses **153GB/s** memory bandwidth. The **14-inch MacBook Pro with plain M5** also tops out at **32GB** and also uses **153GB/s** bandwidth. The **14-inch MacBook Pro with M5 Pro** is a different tier: **15-core CPU / 16-core GPU**, **307GB/s** memory bandwidth, and Apple supports **High Power Mode** on that machine. citeturn201690search2turn190972search1turn498135view0turn236918view3

Based on Apple’s current official specs, **32GB is an option on the plain M5 14-inch MacBook Pro**, not on the **14-inch M5 Pro** model. Apple’s 14-inch MacBook Pro lineup shows **16GB/24GB/32GB** for M5, while the 14-inch **M5 Pro** starts at **24GB** and then steps up to **48GB** or **64GB**. Apple’s buy page shows the **14-inch M5 Pro starts at $2,199**. citeturn498135view0turn807947search2

So there are really **two different comparisons** here.

If you mean the **14-inch MacBook Pro with plain M5 and 32GB** at roughly **$2.1k**, it is **better than the Air**, but the gain is **moderate**, not huge. You get active cooling, the Pro chassis, better screen, more ports, and better sustained performance. You do **not** get more RAM headroom than the Air, and you do **not** get more memory bandwidth than the Air. For your multi-agent use, I would expect it to feel like a **meaningful but incremental** step up over the 15-inch Air 32GB, not a new class of machine. citeturn201690search2turn190972search1turn498135view0

If you mean the **actual 14-inch MacBook Pro with M5 Pro**, that machine is **materially better** on sustained compute: stronger CPU, **2x the memory bandwidth** of M5, High Power Mode support, and Thunderbolt 5. That is a real jump. The catch is that the entry M5 Pro config is **24GB**, so for a workload where Conductor is running multiple agents in isolated workspaces, the lower RAM ceiling can still become the limiter before the CPU does. citeturn236918view2turn236918view3turn924292search0

For your exact workload, I would think about it this way:

- **Air 15 M5, 32GB**: best bridge machine for the money. Plan around **3 serious agents**, **4 as stretch**. citeturn201690search2turn190972search1turn924292search0
- **MBP 14 M5, 32GB**: same RAM ceiling, better sustained thermals. Plan around **4 serious agents**, **5 as stretch**. That is my estimate from the same 32GB memory ceiling plus active cooling. citeturn498135view0turn924292search0
- **MBP 14 M5 Pro, 24GB**: stronger CPU class, but I would not buy it for **multi-agent concurrency** over the Air 32GB unless you know your current pain is mostly sustained heat and build/test load rather than memory pressure. citeturn498135view0turn236918view3turn924292search0

My recommendation is:

**Buy the 15-inch Air with 32GB/1TB** if you are trying to move forward today and protect cash.  
**Buy the 14-inch Pro around $2.1k only if it is the plain M5/32GB model and you care about the better screen, ports, and active cooling.**  
**Buy an actual M5 Pro laptop only if you can stretch to a memory tier that preserves your concurrency headroom.** At **24GB**, I do not think the value is clean for your specific agent-heavy workflow. citeturn498135view0turn807947search2turn190972search1

My blunt answer: **the Pro is meaningfully better only when it is a real M5 Pro with enough memory. The ~$2.1k 32GB Pro-class idea is probably the plain M5 MacBook Pro, and that is better than the Air by a useful but not dramatic margin.**

## User

You’re right it would be a regular m5 chip. Is an m4 pro max or m4 pro a better option? Or buy the 32 air and be done with it

---

## Assistant

Mr. White,

My call: **buy an M4 Pro MacBook Pro if you can get one around Air money. Otherwise buy the 32GB Air and move on. Skip M4 Max unless the price gap is unusually small or you also do GPU-heavy work.** Conductor runs agents in parallel in isolated workspaces and can run multiple dev servers, so your bottleneck is mostly **RAM + sustained thermal headroom**, with memory bandwidth next. citeturn955233search0turn955233search1turn955233search2turn860410search0turn522832search0

Here is the practical breakdown.

The **15-inch Air M5** tops out at **32GB** and has **153GB/s** memory bandwidth. Apple explicitly calls it a **silent fanless design**. The plain **14-inch MacBook Pro M5** also tops out at **32GB** and also has **153GB/s** memory bandwidth. That means the regular M5 Pro-body laptop is better than the Air mainly because of the chassis and sustained-load behavior, not because the chip tier or memory subsystem is dramatically better. citeturn522832search0turn522832search6turn411358view0turn759557view5

The **14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro** is a more meaningful step up for your workload. Apple lists **273GB/s** memory bandwidth on M4 Pro, and the 14-inch M4 Pro model can be configured to **48GB** unified memory. The **M4 Max** jumps again to **410GB/s** or **546GB/s** depending on the bin, with higher memory ceilings, but that class usually costs materially more. citeturn411358view2turn411358view3turn288556search10

On current Apple pricing, the **15-inch Air M5** starts at **$1,299**, the **14-inch M5 MacBook Pro** starts at **$1,699**, and the **14-inch M5 Pro MacBook Pro** starts at **$2,699**. Apple’s refurb store currently shows a **14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro** around **$2,209–$2,289**, while a refurb **14-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro** is around **$2,629**. That is why the M4 Pro is the only “Pro-tier laptop” that really fits the budget conversation you’ve been having. citeturn288556search9turn288556search8turn763764search0turn763764search6turn288556search11

My recommendation by scenario:

**Best answer if you want one machine and you care about budget:**  
Buy the **15-inch Air M5, 32GB/1TB**. It is the cleanest bridge buy. It should be a real upgrade over your current M2 Air because you go from 16GB to 32GB and from 100GB/s on your M2 Air to 153GB/s on M5. I would plan around **3 serious agents**, with **4 as a stretch** if they are lighter and not all hammering builds and dev servers at once. Your current 2022 Air is M2 with **100GB/s** memory bandwidth. citeturn288556search9turn860410search0turn522832search0turn955233search0turn955233search1turn288556search10

**Best answer if you want the least compromise in a laptop:**  
Buy an **M4 Pro MacBook Pro** if you can find one near **$2.2k–$2.3k**. That is the sweet spot. For multi-agent coding, I would take **M4 Pro over regular M5** every time because the memory subsystem is in a different class: **273GB/s vs 153GB/s**, plus higher memory headroom. A **48GB M4 Pro MBP** is materially better than a **32GB Air** for your workload. My estimate is **4 serious agents**, with **5 plausible** if the jobs are mixed and you are not also running a bunch of local infra. citeturn411358view2turn411358view0turn763764search0turn763764search6turn955233search0turn955233search1

**When M4 Max makes sense:**  
Only when the deal is very close to M4 Pro pricing, or you know you need extra GPU/media/local-model headroom. For coding-agent throughput alone, **M4 Max is usually worse value** than **M4 Pro**, because Conductor’s model stresses parallel workspaces, RAM, tests, and dev servers more than raw GPU. I would rather have a good-priced **M4 Pro** than stretch for **M4 Max**. That is an inference from the workload shape plus Apple’s memory-bandwidth and memory-capacity tiers. citeturn955233search0turn955233search1turn955233search2turn411358view2turn411358view3

Blunt version:

- **Air 32GB**: good bridge, good daily driver, still a compromise.
- **M4 Pro MBP**: the best laptop answer for your actual workload.
- **M4 Max MBP**: too expensive for the gain unless you have a special need.

If you want the shortest decision rule: **buy the Air unless you can get an M4 Pro MacBook Pro for within about $300 of the Air config you want.**

All right. Because like cash is tight on this until we raise, I'm going to say we're going to go for the Air, 32 gigabytes of RAM, terabyte drive, and no other upgrades on it. Monthly AppleCare, just to distribute the cost more. If we can get business financing, I would honestly go for a better machine and maybe get one of the M5 pros with 48 or 64 gigabytes of RAM. But if we can't get business financing and we got to pay cash outright, then that's just not affordable right now. So that's where I'm at. I'm walking over to the Apple store right now to go take a look at some of these things. My main thing that I would be curious about is, do we have, you know, do we have any anything that would, I guess, I guess my main concern is like the M2 that I have right now, the chassis has got like a couple nicks in it. Hardware-wise, nothing is bad, screen's fine, all the hardware is great, but there's like a couple nicks in the laptop where it's clear there was like a minor impact into like concrete or something that left like a little nicks in the side. But that's the only visible wear or tear at all on it. And my main concern would just be like, to get some cash back. Is an Apple trade-in worth it or throwing on eBay worth it or anything? And like realistically, an M2 2022 machine, 16 gig RAM. What are we looking at for that, you know? So, that's what I'm curious about.

Mr. White,

Realistically, your **2022 13-inch MacBook Air M2, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD** is probably worth **more in a private sale than as an Apple trade-in**. Apple’s current MacBook Air trade-in ceiling is **up to $485**, and Apple says the actual value depends on the device’s condition and configuration; in-store values can differ from online estimates after inspection. citeturn414865search1turn751243view2

For the used market, the strongest current benchmark I found is **Swappa’s March 16, 2026 pricing**: the **2022 M2 Air 13-inch / 1TB** shows an **average sale price of $791** and an **average list price of $839**. Recent 16GB/1TB examples are right in that band: a **Good-condition** unit was listed at **$824**, and a **new** one at **$855**. citeturn305309search0turn305309search2turn305309search1

eBay is usually worse on net. eBay says most categories are charged **13.6% plus $0.40 per order**, while Swappa says sellers pay **3% of the ask price** plus payment processing. On a **$799** eBay sale, that leaves about **$689.94 before shipping**. On Swappa, a **$791** sale leaves about **$767.27 before payment processing**, and an **$824** sale leaves about **$799.28 before payment processing**. citeturn884091view0turn414865search2turn604463calculator0turn604463calculator2turn604463calculator1

So the practical ranking is:

**1. Swappa** — best balance of cash vs hassle.  
**2. Apple trade-in** — worst cash, easiest transaction.  
**3. eBay** — broad audience, but fees are heavy. citeturn414865search2turn884091view0

About the nicks: I would expect them to matter **more for Apple trade-in grading** than for a private buyer, as long as the screen, keyboard, ports, battery, and enclosure integrity are otherwise good. Apple explicitly says the final value can change if the condition does not match what you described, and the in-store specialist evaluates it on the spot. That means a couple visible impact marks could push you below the headline estimate. citeturn751243view2

My blunt estimate for **your** machine today:

- **Apple trade-in:** probably **$350–$485**
- **Swappa sale price:** probably **$750–$825 gross**
- **eBay sale price:** roughly similar gross, but worse net after fees citeturn414865search1turn305309search0turn305309search2turn913093view0turn884091view0

What I would do while you’re walking into the store: get the **in-store Apple trade-in quote first**. If they come in anywhere near **$450+** and you want zero friction, take it. If they come in materially lower, I would buy the new Air and sell the old one on **Swappa**. That is the best odds of getting a meaningful chunk of cash back. citeturn751243view2turn414865search2turn305309search0

If you want, I can give you the exact listing title and pricing strategy I’d use for Swappa so it moves fast.
