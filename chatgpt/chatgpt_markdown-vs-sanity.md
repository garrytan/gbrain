## User

should we use sanity for our blog or just marcdoc files

Mr. White,

Short answer: **use Markdown files unless you have a strong, specific reason to add Sanity.**

### Markdown files (recommended for most startups)
**Best when:**
- Engineers own the blog
- Low publishing volume
- SEO + performance matter
- You want minimal tooling and zero vendor lock-in

**Pros**
- Dead simple (GitHub, PRs, versioning)
- Fast builds, fewer moving parts
- Easy with Next.js, Astro, or similar
- No CMS cost or operational overhead

**Cons**
- Non-technical writers need help
- No live preview or rich editorial workflow

**Verdict:** For an early-stage startup blog, this is usually the correct choice.

---

### Sanity (headless CMS)
**Best when:**
- Non-technical marketers publish frequently
- You need drafts, previews, roles, approvals
- Blog is part of a broader content system (landing pages, docs, localization)

**Pros**
- Excellent editor experience
- Structured content scales well
- Real-time previews
- Strong API

**Cons**
- Extra infra + mental overhead
- CMS schema maintenance
- Vendor dependency
- Slower iteration for engineers

**Verdict:** Use only if content velocity and editorial complexity justify it.

---

### Practical recommendation
- **Start with Markdown.**
- If marketing later demands autonomy, migrate selectively to Sanity.
- Migration path is straightforward if you keep front-matter clean.

If you want, I can give you a **decision checklist** or a **hybrid setup** (Markdown now, CMS later without refactor).

do you have to pay for sanity

Yes — **Sanity has a free tier, but paid plans exist if you need more capacity or features.**citeturn0search0turn0search1

**Free Plan**
- You can start and run a project on Sanity without paying anything. Every project starts on a **free plan** with quotas for API usage, bandwidth, storage/assets, and users.citeturn0search0turn0search1  
- The free tier includes a decent amount of usage for a small site or blog.citeturn0search9

**Paid Plans**
- Beyond the free tier, Sanity offers **paid plans** with higher limits and collaboration features.citeturn0search0  
- A common structure is a **Growth plan that bills around $15 per user per month**, giving more features like private datasets, content releases, scheduled publishing, and larger quotas.citeturn0search12  
- Larger business and enterprise plans with custom pricing exist too.citeturn0search0

**Summary**
- **Yes — you *can* use Sanity free forever** for a small project.citeturn0search0  
- You **only pay** if you outgrow the free limits or want team/collaboration features.citeturn0search1

If your blog is simple and low-traffic, you can likely stay on the free plan indefinitely. If it gets lots of content or editors, you’ll eventually hit paid tiers.
