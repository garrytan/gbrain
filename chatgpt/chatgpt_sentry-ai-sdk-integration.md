Here’s a concise overview of how **Sentry** works with **AI and AI-related SDKs**:

### What Sentry Is
Sentry is a developer-focused **error tracking and performance monitoring platform**. It captures crashes, exceptions, and performance data from your code in real time so you can diagnose and fix issues faster. It does this through **official SDKs** available across many languages and frameworks (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.). citeturn0search6

### AI Features in Sentry
Sentry has added **AI-driven capabilities** to extend traditional monitoring:

**1. AI-Assisted Debugging (Seer)**
- *Seer* is Sentry’s AI debugging agent that analyzes issues, gives context-aware insights, and helps resolve errors and performance issues faster. citeturn0search0

**2. AI Observability / Agent Monitoring**
- Sentry can now monitor **AI agents and LLM usage** in your applications.
- You can track model **latency, token usage, errors, and cost**, and see full execution traces of agent runs within the Sentry UI. citeturn0search2turn0search4

**3. AI Code Review**
- In beta, Sentry offers **AI-powered code review** that predicts bugs, reviews pull requests for logic issues, and can even auto-generate unit tests before code hits production. citeturn0search8

### AI SDK Integration Context
- There isn’t a single “Sentry AI SDK” separate from Sentry’s existing SDKs; instead, Sentry **augments error tracking with AI-powered tooling** and observability features.
- When instrumenting LLM/AI components, Sentry integrates with existing **AI SDKs and frameworks** via its agent monitoring features (e.g., OpenAI, Vercel AI SDK) to capture traces and metrics for those calls. citeturn0search4

### What You Get
With Sentry + AI support you can:
- Detect and diagnose errors faster using both telemetry and AI suggestions.
- Monitor and **debug LLM/AI workflows** just like other parts of your app.
- Prioritize high-impact issues with insights that combine production context + AI analysis. citeturn0search0turn0search2

If you want help instrumenting a specific language/framework or linking Sentry to a particular AI SDK you’re using (e.g., OpenAI in Node), tell me the environment and I can give concrete setup steps.
