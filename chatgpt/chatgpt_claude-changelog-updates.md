## User

sum up the changes i should know about

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — here’s the **signal-only summary** of what actually matters in the recent **Claude / Claude Code** changelog. No fluff.

---

## 🚀 Big Things You Should Know

### 1. **Claude Code is now a serious agent platform**
- Background agents + task system are mature.
- Agents can:
  - Run asynchronously
  - Track dependencies
  - Recover from permission denials
  - Switch models dynamically
- Practical takeaway: **long, multi-step coding workflows finally work without babysitting**.

---

### 2. **Permissions & security got much stricter (and smarter)**
- Permissions now respect **content-level intent**, not just tool allowlists.
- Wildcards like `Bash(*)` are no longer silently dangerous.
- Multiple real vulnerabilities fixed (command injection, permission bypass, token leaks).
- Net effect: **safer by default, fewer “oops it ran rm -rf” moments**.

---

### 3. **Context & memory handling massively improved**
- Auto-compaction is faster and more reliable.
- Large outputs are now persisted to disk instead of truncated.
- Context window usage is tracked precisely (used vs remaining).
- Claude now **continues automatically** if output hits token limits.
- Result: **far fewer broken sessions on big codebases**.

---

### 4. **IDE / VS Code integration leveled up**
- Native VS Code extension is stable.
- Key upgrades:
  - Session forking & rewind
  - LSP support (go-to-definition, references, hover)
  - Python venv auto-activation
  - OAuth/session stability fixes
- Translation: **Claude finally behaves like a real IDE copilot, not a chat toy**.

---

### 5. **Claude Opus 4.5 is the default “thinking” workhorse**
- Thinking mode on by default for Opus 4.5.
- Haiku 4.5 used for execution when appropriate.
- Subagents can choose cheaper/faster models automatically.
- Practical result: **better reasoning without burning tokens blindly**.

---

### 6. **Plugins & MCP ecosystem stabilized**
- Plugins, hooks, MCP servers are now:
  - Version-pinnable
  - Hot-reloadable
  - Searchable
- Claude auto-discovers tools only when needed (huge context savings).
- Bottom line: **tool sprawl no longer kills context**.

---

### 7. **Terminal UX is dramatically better**
- Faster rendering (especially with Unicode / emoji).
- Real keyboard customization.
- Vim mode is actually usable now.
- Less flicker, fewer crashes, cleaner diffs.

---

## TL;DR (Executive Version)

- Claude Code ≠ beta anymore — it’s **production-grade**.
- Agents + tasks are now reliable.
- Security holes closed.
- Context handling fixed.
- VS Code experience is finally legit.
- Opus 4.5 + Haiku 4.5 model routing is smart and cost-aware.

If you want, I can:
- Compare Claude Code vs Cursor / Copilot **for real dev workflows**
- Flag **what’s still broken**
- Recommend **optimal config for startup engineering teams**

---

## User

i need a guide on prompting to fully leverage the new tasks manager updates

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — here’s a **practical prompting guide** to fully exploit the **new Tasks Manager** in Claude Code. This is based on how the system *actually behaves*, not marketing.

---

## 1. Think in **Tasks**, not conversations

### What changed
Tasks are now:
- First-class execution units
- Stateful
- Resilient to permission denials
- Able to retry with alternative strategies
- Dependency-aware

### Prompting rule
**Always describe work as an objective with constraints**, not a chat request.

**Bad**
> “Can you refactor this file?”

**Good**
> “Create a background task to refactor `auth.ts` to remove duplication, preserve public APIs, and keep changes under 200 LOC.”

Why it works:
- Claude knows this should be a **Task**, not a one-shot answer
- It plans, executes, verifies, and reports

---

## 2. Explicitly declare **task boundaries**

Claude now respects task scope very strictly.

### Use this structure
```
Objective:
Constraints:
Inputs:
Outputs:
Definition of done:
```

**Example**
```
Objective:
Extract a reusable pagination utility.

Constraints:
- No breaking API changes
- TypeScript strict mode
- No new dependencies

Inputs:
- src/api/users.ts
- src/api/orders.ts

Outputs:
- New utility module
- Updated call sites
- Diff only, no explanations

Definition of done:
- All tests pass
- No duplicated pagination logic remains
```

This dramatically improves:
- Task planning quality
- Retry behavior after failures
- Auto-compaction summaries

---

## 3. Leverage **dependency-aware tasks**

Tasks can now depend on other tasks.

### Prompt pattern
> “Create Task A. Once it completes successfully, create Task B that depends on its output.”

**Example**
> “Create a task to audit all permission checks. When complete, start a dependent task to harden any risky Bash permissions found.”

Claude will:
- Serialize execution correctly
- Pass artifacts via disk, not context
- Avoid re-reading files unnecessarily

---

## 4. Design for **permission denials (on purpose)**

New behavior:  
If a task hits a permission denial, it **keeps going**.

### Prompt for fallback logic
> “If a tool permission is denied, attempt a read-only or file-tool alternative before asking again.”

This unlocks:
- Fewer interruptions
- Smarter retries
- Better agent autonomy

---

## 5. Use **tasks for long-running or risky work only**

Claude now auto-backgrounds tasks, but you should still signal intent.

### When to force a task
- Refactors
- Repo-wide changes
- Migrations
- Audits
- Anything involving Bash

### Prompt signal words that trigger task mode
- “Create a task…”
- “Run this asynchronously…”
- “Background this…”
- “Track progress and notify on completion…”

---

## 6. Ask for **incremental task reporting**

Tasks can now emit partial results.

### Prompt pattern
> “Report progress after each major step and write intermediate artifacts to disk.”

This gives you:
- Visibility without token spam
- Inspectable outputs
- Better failure recovery

---

## 7. Explicitly control **model delegation**

Subtasks can choose cheaper/faster models unless you say otherwise.

### Prompt example
> “Use Opus for planning and review. Use Haiku for execution steps unless reasoning is required.”

This reduces:
- Cost
- Latency
- Overthinking on mechanical steps

---

## 8. Close tasks cleanly (this matters now)

Claude now tracks task lifecycle tightly.

### Always end with
> “When complete, summarize changes and confirm the definition of done.”

This improves:
- Resume reliability
- Task history clarity
- Future session compaction

---

## TL;DR Prompting Cheat Sheet

**Do**
- Declare objectives + constraints
- Use “Create a task…”
- Define done
- Expect retries
- Chain tasks intentionally

**Don’t**
- Chat vaguely
- Mix planning and execution in one blob
- Assume permission denials kill execution
- Let tasks sprawl without boundaries

---

If you want next:
- A **copy-paste task prompt template**
- A **“Claude as staff engineer” task style**
- A comparison of **Claude Tasks vs Cursor agents**  

Say the word.
