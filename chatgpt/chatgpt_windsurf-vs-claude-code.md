## User

Windsurf vs claude code for performance and accuracy. Base don the most current release of both

---

## Assistant

Short answer:  

- **Pure accuracy on hard coding tasks:** Claude Code (using **Sonnet 4.5**) is clearly ahead.  
- **Speed + “vibe coding” inside an IDE:** Windsurf (using **SWE-1.5**) is generally faster and nicer to drive, but slightly behind on raw correctness vs Sonnet 4.5.  

Below is the “why,” based on *current* releases.

---

## 1. Model quality / accuracy

### Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)

Claude Code’s “native” heavy model is **Claude Sonnet 4.5**:

- Sonnet 4.5 is currently **at or near the top of SWE-bench Verified**, a standard benchmark for real-world GitHub bug-fixing. Public leaderboards and independent evals show it #1 with ~70–77% on SWE-bench Verified, ahead of GPT-5 Codex and others. citeturn2search3turn2search8turn2search19turn2search13  
- Anthropic explicitly positions Sonnet 4.5 as their **best coding and agents model**, and Claude Code is one of the main products that ships those capabilities (CLI, VS Code extension, and now web). citeturn3search0turn3search4turn3search2  
- Benchmarks and vendor writeups consistently show **state-of-the-art performance on agentic coding and computer-use tasks** (OSWorld, agentic coding evals, etc.). citeturn2search2turn2search10turn3search5  

**Implication:** if you care about maximum chance that a single agent run correctly fixes a bug or implements a complex feature across a big repo, **Claude Code + Sonnet 4.5 is currently the stronger bet.**

---

### Windsurf (SWE-1 / SWE-1.5 and other models)

Windsurf is an **AI-native IDE** that lets you pick models in its Cascade panel (Llama 3.1, GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude variants where available, and now its own SWE models). citeturn1search1turn1search7turn1search14  

For its *own* models:

- **SWE-1**: Windsurf’s first frontier coding model, optimized for the full software engineering process (not just code generation). Their own writeup says SWE-1 is competitive with **Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro on internal programming benchmarks**, but **below newer frontier models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet** on software-engineering tasks. citeturn2search6turn1search12  
- **SWE-1.5** (2025-10/29) is an upgraded frontier-size model, now available inside Windsurf. Independent and vendor writeups describe it as **near-SOTA for coding but still short of the very top models (GPT-5 Codex, Claude Sonnet 4.5)**. citeturn2search12turn2search9  

You *can* also call **Sonnet 4.5** from inside Windsurf via external providers, but:

- Anthropic significantly **limited Windsurf’s direct access** to Claude 3.x/4.x earlier this year for business reasons, forcing Windsurf to route via third-party compute for many Claude models. citeturn1search2turn1search10turn1news19turn0news34  
- Practically, that means Claude models inside Windsurf may be **less “default” and sometimes more constrained** than Sonnet 4.5 inside Claude Code, which is Anthropic’s own home turf.

**Implication:** Windsurf’s in-house SWE-1.5 is **very strong**, but the best public data we have puts it a notch below Sonnet 4.5 on the hardest agentic coding benchmarks.

---

## 2. Performance / speed

### Windsurf (SWE-1.5)

This is where Windsurf shines:

- SWE-1.5 is explicitly marketed and benchmarked as a **high-throughput coding model**. Windsurf/Cognition say it can stream up to **~950 tokens/second**, served via Cerebras hardware. citeturn2search12turn2search23turn1search8  
- Multiple posts compare this to **Claude Sonnet 4.5** with claims like “~13× faster than Sonnet 4.5” and about **6× faster than Haiku 4.5**, depending on settings and serving stack. citeturn2search12turn2search23turn1search8  

In practice that means:

- Big multi-file edits, scaffolded projects, or framework boilerplate generation **feel much snappier** in Windsurf when you’re using SWE-1.5.
- For “vibe coding” where you’re constantly iterating, the lower latency is a real quality-of-life win.

### Claude Code (Sonnet / Haiku 4.5)

Claude Code gets speed from the **model tier you pick**:

- **Haiku 4.5** is Anthropic’s lightweight, fast model, tuned for real-time coding/chat; it’s significantly faster than Sonnet, and available to all Claude users. citeturn0news20  
- **Sonnet 4.5** is slower but designed for **deep reasoning and long-horizon tasks**—Anthropic shows it running **over 30 hours autonomously** on complex coding work. citeturn3search0turn3news9turn3news14  

So:  

- If you pick **Haiku 4.5** in Claude Code, speed is good, but **still not at the extreme throughput numbers SWE-1.5 is claiming**.  
- If you pick **Sonnet 4.5**, you’re trading some interactivity for higher success rates on gnarly problems.

## 3. Workflow & tooling differences (affects effective accuracy)

This isn’t “model quality,” but it absolutely changes how correct the end result is in real life.

### Windsurf

- **Full IDE (VS Code fork)** with AI built-in: autocomplete (Tab), chat, previews, and 1-click deploy for web apps. citeturn1search9turn0search14  
- **Cascade** agent that can:
  - Navigate your repo,
  - Run commands/tests,
  - Work across multiple files,
  - Use different backbone models per task. citeturn0search1turn1search7turn1search14  
- Especially strong for **frontend/full-stack “build this app quickly and iterate visually”** via live preview + inline editing. citeturn1search9turn0search14  

### Claude Code

- **Runs in your terminal + VS Code extension + web “Code” tab**. No new IDE; it integrates with your existing CLI and tools (git, test runners, build scripts, MCP servers). citeturn3search2turn3search4turn3news10  
- Designed as a **repo-scale, agentic coding CLI**:
  - Reads issues, writes code, runs tests, opens PRs.
  - Can manage million-line codebases and run for very long sessions. citeturn0search11turn3search0turn3search7  
- Recent updates add **checkpoints, sandboxing (filesystem/network isolation), and better autonomous behaviour**, which reduces “oops it just trashed my repo” moments. citeturn0search13turn3search0turn3search4  

**Net effect on “accuracy”:**

- Windsurf’s tight IDE integration makes it easy to **see and manually correct mistakes fast**—good for interactive building.
- Claude Code’s repo-wide reasoning + long autonomous runs tends to **get harder end-to-end tasks “fully done”** with fewer manual interventions, especially when using Sonnet 4.5.

---

## 4. So, which should *you* use?

If I had to give you a **practical rule of thumb** today, Mr. White:

### Pick **Claude Code** if:

- You care most about **max correctness** on:
  - Deep bug-hunting in large codebases,
  -Complex refactors,
  - Multi-hour autonomous tasks.
- You’re comfortable living in the **terminal / existing IDE + extension**.
- You want the **current SOTA coding model (Sonnet 4.5)** driving the agent. citeturn3search0turn2search10turn2search16turn2news36  

### Pick **Windsurf** if:

- You want the **smoothest, fastest “AI-first IDE” experience**.
- You do a lot of **frontend/full-stack work**, rapid prototyping, and appreciate live preview + one-click deploy.
- You’re happy with **near-top-tier accuracy** and value **SWE-1.5’s speed** more than squeezing out the last few percentage points of benchmark accuracy. citeturn2search12turn2search9turn0search14turn1search9  

### A very strong setup

Honestly, a lot of serious devs are doing something like:

- **Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)** for the hard, repo-spanning tasks and gnarly debugging, plus  
- **Windsurf + SWE-1.5** as the fast, interactive IDE for day-to-day coding and UI work.

If you tell me what stack you’re mainly using (backend language, frontend framework, size of repo), I can give a more concrete recommendation and a “how to set each tool up for that stack” checklist.
