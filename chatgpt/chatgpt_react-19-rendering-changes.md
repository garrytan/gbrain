Here’s what **React 19 changed about rendering and related behavior** — focusing on what you likely mean by “rendered more”:

### 🧠 New Rendering Model & Async-Friendly Behavior
React 19 is a major release that **rebuilt parts of the rendering system** to better support async workflows, server components, and concurrent scheduling.citeturn0search0turn0search22

**Key changes affecting rendering and update behavior:**
- **Actions & Async transitions:** Built-in support for async functions in transitions so React can handle pending states, errors, and optimistic updates automatically rather than you managing manual state flags. This changes when and how updates are scheduled and committed.citeturn0search0  
- **New Hooks like `useOptimistic`, `useActionState`:** These help manage optimistic UI updates and async states, potentially triggering what looks like extra rendering if state signs change.citeturn0search0  
- **Server Components (RSC):** React 19 expands server rendering capabilities, letting components run on the server and stream HTML progressively — which can reduce client JS execution and change hydration/render patterns.citeturn0search12  
- **Improved hydration and diffing:** The React team improved the reconciliation and hydration internals, which can sometimes cause different render behavior compared to older versions.citeturn0search27

### 📊 Does React 19 *actually* render more often?
React 19 **doesn’t arbitrarily render components more** by default — but the new scheduling and concurrent logic can make update timing behave differently compared to v18:
- You might **observe more renders in dev mode** because of stricter checks and new internal behaviors.  
- If props or state change more frequently (e.g., through new async state hooks), React will schedule more updates — which *can look like more renders*.  
- Some users reported that under certain conditions (like complex tables) React 19 felt slower or triggered more render processing, possibly due to deeper diffing or scheduler changes.citeturn0search9

### 📌 Summary
React 19 changed rendering behavior mainly by:
- Introducing **async transitions and actions**, letting React control pending/error/optimistic states internally.citeturn0search0  
- Expanding **server rendering and Streaming SSR**, which alters where and how rendering work happens.citeturn0search12  
- Adjusting the internal scheduler and reconciliation logic, which can look like “more renders” especially in dev or when using new async patterns.citeturn0search27

If you want, I can explain specific render patterns or performance adjustments in React 19 (e.g., why a particular component re-renders more).
