## User

Application error: a client-side exception has occurred while loading localhost (see the browser console for more information).

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — that message means your app **crashed in the browser before it could render**. This is almost always a JavaScript/runtime issue, not the server failing to start.

Here’s a **tight, fact-first checklist** to isolate it fast:

---

## 1. Open the browser console (this matters)
- Chrome: **Cmd+Option+J** (Mac) / **Ctrl+Shift+J** (Win)
- Reload the page.
- **The red error above the stack trace is the real problem.**

Common examples:
- `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined`
- `ReferenceError: window is not defined`
- `Hydration failed`
- `Module not found`

Paste that error if you want exact diagnosis.

---

## 2. If this is **Next.js** (very common)
Most frequent causes:

### ❌ Using browser-only APIs during SSR
```js
window
document
localStorage
navigator
```

**Fix**
```js
useEffect(() => {
  // browser-only code
}, [])
```
or guard:
```js
if (typeof window !== "undefined") { ... }
```

---

### ❌ Importing something that breaks SSR
Examples:
- chart libraries
- map SDKs
- analytics scripts

**Fix**
```js
import dynamic from "next/dynamic"

const ClientOnlyComponent = dynamic(
  () => import("./Component"),
  { ssr: false }
)
```

---

### ❌ Mismatch between server and client render
Typical causes:
- `Math.random()`
- `Date.now()`
- reading from `localStorage` in render

**Fix**: move to `useEffect` or memoize after mount.

---

## 3. Clear obvious landmines
Run these in order:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules .next
npm install
npm run dev
```

If using Vite:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules dist
```

---

## 4. Environment variables
Client-side crash if:
- Variable is undefined
- Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix (Next.js)

```js
console.log(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL)
```

If it logs `undefined`, that’s your bug.

---

## 5. If this started “suddenly”
Check:
- Recent dependency upgrade
- React 18 strict mode double-invocation
- Node version mismatch

```bash
node -v
```

Mismatch between teammates = classic silent killer.

---

### Bottom line
That message is **not the bug**, just the symptom.  
The **first red console error** is always the answer.

If you paste:
- the **console error**
- framework (Next / Vite / CRA)
- recent change

I’ll tell you exactly where it’s breaking and why.

## User

## Error Type
Runtime Error

## Error Message
Rendered more hooks than during the previous render.

Next.js version: 16.1.1 (Turbopack)

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — this is a **hard React rules violation**, not a Next.js bug. The error is precise.

> **“Rendered more hooks than during the previous render”**  
= **You are calling hooks conditionally or inconsistently.**

React detected that **render #1 used N hooks, render #2 used N+1**.

---

## The rule you broke (non-negotiable)
**Hooks must be called:**
- at the **top level**
- in the **same order**
- on **every render**

No exceptions. React enforces this at runtime.

---

## The usual culprits (90% of cases)

### ❌ Hook inside a conditional
```tsx
if (isLoggedIn) {
  useEffect(() => {}, [])
}
```

✅ Fix
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isLoggedIn) return
}, [isLoggedIn])
```

---

### ❌ Hook after an early return
```tsx
if (!data) return null

useEffect(() => {}, [])
```

✅ Fix
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (!data) return
}, [data])

if (!data) return null
```

---

### ❌ Hook inside a loop
```tsx
items.map(item => {
  useState(false)
})
```

✅ Fix  
State must be **outside**, data-driven inside.

---

### ❌ Hook inside a function that *might* run
```tsx
function init() {
  useEffect(() => {}, [])
}

if (ready) init()
```

❌ Never allowed.

---

## Next.js–specific traps (very common)

### ❌ Client/server divergence
```tsx
if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  useEffect(() => {}, [])
}
```

This renders:
- server: ❌ hook skipped
- client: ✅ hook called  
→ **hook count mismatch**

✅ Fix
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window === "undefined") return
}, [])
```

---

### ❌ Conditional client components
```tsx
if (!mounted) return null
useEffect(...)
```

This **will break** if `mounted` flips.

---

## How to find it fast (2 minutes)

1. Open the file mentioned **first** in the stack trace
2. Count hooks **top to bottom**
3. Look for:
   - `if`, `return`, `try/catch`
   - hooks after JSX conditionals
4. The broken hook is **always below a conditional path**

---

## Nuclear debug method (guaranteed)
Temporarily log render order:

```tsx
console.log("render start")

useState()
console.log("after useState")

useEffect(...)
console.log("after useEffect")
```

Reload. The last log before the crash tells you **which hook disappears**.

---

## Turbopack note (important)
Turbopack makes this **surface faster**, but it’s not the cause.  
Switching to Webpack won’t fix it.

---

### Bottom line
This is **100% deterministic**:
- A hook is **not being called on every render**
- Fix the conditional → error disappears instantly

If you paste **the component code**, I’ll point to the **exact line** that violates the rule.

## User

known issue in react 19

---

## Assistant

Short answer: **Yes — there *are* real React 19 issues, but this specific “Rendered more hooks…” error is not a documented React bug in the core library itself.** Most React 19 problems reported recently relate to ecosystem compatibility or specific edge cases, not a broad hooks regression. citeturn0search1turn0search3

Here’s the accurate breakdown:

### 📌 1) Official pattern violation is still the most common root cause
React’s hook rules (same number/order each render) still apply in v19, and violating them will reliably trigger this error. That’s the canonical cause, not a general framework regression. citeturn0search0

### 📌 2) There *are* React 19 related bugs reported involving hooks logic
There’s *one* reported issue where React 19 (e.g., 19.1.0) could throw **“Rendered more hooks…”** even when hooks aren’t conditionally called — suspected to be an internal bug tied to Suspense/use interaction or server-action transitions. It’s hard to reproduce and isn’t confirmed as a root case by the React team, but exists on GitHub. citeturn0search3

### 📌 3) Ecosystem incompatibilities can masquerade as React bugs
Issues with certain libraries (Ionic types, React Hook Form not behaving as expected under new rendering internals) and tooling (Next.js / Turbopack) can surface weird behavior that *looks* like hooks errors but are actually compatibility problems with how React 19 changed streaming/Suspense scheduling. citeturn0search1turn0search21

### 📌 4) React 19 itself has other bugs/patches unrelated to this
There were serious vulnerabilities and subsequent patches in React Server Components (React 19.x). Upgrading off early React 19 could resolve many quirks. citeturn0search18

---

## Bottom line
- **Not a wholesale React 19 hooks regression**, but there *are* specific edge cases where React may throw this error even without invalid code. citeturn0search3  
- Always check your component for conditional hooks first — that’s still the most reliable root cause. citeturn0search0  
- If you’re on an early React 19 release, upgrading to the latest patch (e.g., 19.1.2 / 19.2.x) is strongly recommended.

---

If you want, I can help you verify whether your specific code path is triggering the **true React bug** vs a *conditional hook pattern problem* — just share the component’s render function that fails.
