Yes. Multiple sources and developer inspections indicate the urlOpenAI Codex appturn0search0 desktop client is built with Electron. citeturn0search4turn0search11turn0search15

Specifically:
- It uses Electron + Node.js under the hood. citeturn0search11turn0search15
- People have unpacked the app and found standard Electron structures like `app.asar`. citeturn0search7turn0search11
- The DevClass coverage explicitly states it is “built with Electron.” citeturn0search4turn0search5

That said, OpenAI is clearly optimizing it heavily for agent workflows:
- built-in git worktrees
- local shell execution
- SQLite persistence
- multi-agent orchestration
- native-ish mac integrations

So it’s Electron, but closer to VS Code / Cursor quality than a typical thin web wrapper.
