## User

Is there any kind of tool that can scan through all of my iMessage history, like, forever, and then parse it or dump it into, like, a vector database or something, or load it into GBrain?

---

## Assistant

I’ll treat this as a practical architecture question: what exists, what Apple allows, and what I’d actually use for a local-first Jovie/GBrain-style memory pipeline.

---

## Assistant

Yes, Mr. White.

## Best option

Use **`imessage-exporter`** to dump your Mac/iPhone backup iMessage history, then pipe it into your own embedding pipeline. It reads macOS `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` or iOS backups and exports to readable formats like TXT/HTML. citeturn225354search1turn225354search14

## Practical pipeline

```text
iMessage chat.db
→ imessage-exporter
→ JSON/Markdown normalization
→ chunk by thread/date/person
→ embed
→ store in GBrain/vector DB
→ query with permissions + citations
```

## Better dev route

LangChain has an **iMessage chat loader** that directly loads from macOS `chat.db`, which is probably the fastest prototype path if you want to build a local ingestion script. citeturn225354search13

## Caveats

- Apple does **not** provide a clean official full-history export API.
- On macOS, Messages are stored in SQLite at `~/Library/Messages/chat.db`. citeturn225354search3
- You’ll likely need **Full Disk Access** for Terminal/script access.
- It only sees what is actually synced/downloaded locally or present in an iOS backup; it cannot magically read iCloud-only messages. citeturn225354search14
- This is extremely sensitive data. I’d keep the whole pipeline **local-first**, encrypt the vector DB, and avoid uploading raw message text to third-party services.

## My recommendation

Build a small local tool:

```text
Mac app / CLI
→ asks for Full Disk Access
→ copies chat.db read-only
→ extracts messages + attachments metadata
→ redacts phone/email where needed
→ embeds locally or through your chosen model
→ writes into GBrain as private memory
```

For Jovie/GBrain, this is powerful: it turns years of texts into searchable relationship/context memory. But do it opt-in, local-first, and with strict per-contact controls.

Should we just build the future of CRMs? Or is Jovie as is stronger?

---

## Assistant

Mr. White, **Jovie as-is is stronger**.

## The correct move

Build **the CRM for artists**, not “the future of CRMs.”

That keeps the wedge sharp:

```text
Artist profile
+ fan identity
+ release history
+ click/listen/event/merch intent
+ AI memory
+ automated actions
= artist revenue OS
```

## Why broad CRM is weaker

A generic CRM puts you against:

- Salesforce
- HubSpot
- Attio
- Clay
- Folk
- every AI sales agent startup

That market is huge, but the wedge is crowded and abstract. You lose your unfair advantage: **you deeply understand artists, music releases, fan monetization, and the messy reality of creative work.**

## Stronger thesis

Jovie should become:

> **The AI operating system that helps artists turn attention into revenue.**

CRM is one module inside that.

## Product framing

Do this:

```text
Jovie Profile → captures intent
Fan Alerts → turns intent into owned audience
Fan CRM → understands who matters
AI Agent → recommends and executes revenue moves
```

Examples:

- “These 312 fans clicked merch twice but never bought.”
- “These 41 fans are in LA and opened your event alert.”
- “This fan always clicks vinyl links.”
- “This promoter replied 3 times but never booked.”
- “This TikTok drove 87 email signups and 14 merch clicks.”

That is much more valuable than “AI CRM.”

## Best positioning

Do **not** say:

> Jovie is a CRM.

Say:

> Jovie helps artists build, understand, and monetize their audience automatically.

Then internally, yes, you are building a vertical CRM.

## Verdict

Stay with Jovie.

Expand into CRM through the artist wedge.

The endgame can be a creative-business CRM, but the entry point should be **music artists turning fan attention into money**.
