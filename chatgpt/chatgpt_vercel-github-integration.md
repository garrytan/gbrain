Here’s a concise overview of how to integrate entity["brand", "Vercel", 0] with entity["software", "GitHub", 0] — especially relevant to your startup workflows, Mr. White.

### ✅ What you get by connecting them  
- Every **push** to GitHub can trigger a **deployment** on Vercel, including preview deploys for branches and pull requests. citeturn0search0turn0search1  
- Merging into your designated “production” branch (often `main`) triggers a production deployment. citeturn0search1turn0search13  
- You can perform automated rollbacks — Vercel will serve a previous deployment if you revert the commit. citeturn0search0  
- Using GitHub Actions you can get finer-control CI/CD pipelines (lint/test/build) *and then* deploy to Vercel. citeturn0search9turn0search11  

---

### 🔧 How to set it up  
Here are typical steps:

1. In Vercel: import a GitHub repository into Vercel as a “New Project”. It will ask to authorize GitHub and access repos. citeturn0search0turn0search13  
2. Choose the project settings: build command, framework preset, root directory, environment variables. citeturn0search1turn0search13  
3. In GitHub: optionally set up GitHub Actions workflow to control when builds/deploys happen (e.g., only run tests first, then deploy). citeturn0search9turn0search12  
4. In Vercel Project → Settings → Git (or “Git Settings”): you can adjust things like: ignore‐builds for certain commits/folders, disconnecting repo, or enabling deploy hooks. citeturn0search7turn0search0

### ⚠️ Things to watch / startup tips  
- If you use the GitHub integration built-into Vercel (zero-config), it’s easy and fast — great for small teams. But if you need custom CI (tests, multiple steps) you may prefer the GitHub Actions + Vercel deployment approach. citeturn0search11  
- For forked PRs: by default Vercel may block deployment if it’s from a fork (to protect env variables). You’ll need to configure “Git Fork Protection” under settings if you want that. citeturn0search0  
- If you have large assets with Git LFS, enable it in Git Settings so Vercel pulls them correctly. citeturn0search7  
- Make sure environment variables secrets (API keys, etc) are set in Vercel and/or GitHub secrets (if using Actions) to avoid production misconfigurations.  
- Choose your production branch carefully: the default is usually the default branch in GitHub like `main` but you can change it in Vercel. citeturn0search1turn0search7

If you like, I can **walk you through a step-by-step setup** specifically for your project (e.g., with `main` branch, Next.js, custom domain) and include a sample GitHub Actions workflow file. Would that be helpful?
