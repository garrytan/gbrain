Here’s a concise guide to **1Password and environment variables (`env`)** — specifically how to use 1Password with environment variables in development workflows:

---

## 🔐 1Password CLI & Environment Variables

### 1) Built-in **CLI env settings**
1Password CLI supports several internal environment variables you can set to customize its behavior:

- **`OP_CONFIG_DIR`** – where the CLI reads/writes config.  
- **`OP_CONNECT_HOST` / `OP_CONNECT_TOKEN`** – for 1Password Connect API.  
- **`OP_DEBUG`** – enable debug logging (`true`/`false`).  
- **`OP_FORMAT`** – output format (`json`, `human-readable`).  
- **`OP_INCLUDE_ARCHIVE`**, **`OP_ISO_TIMESTAMPS`**, **`OP_RUN_NO_MASKING`** – toggle specific behaviors.  
- **`OP_SESSION`** – session token storage.  
- **`OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`** – authenticate with a service account. citeturn0search1

## 🛠️ 2) Injecting Secrets as Environment Variables

1Password doesn’t automatically export your vault values into your shell **persistently** like a `.env` file. Instead, you reference secrets and *inject* them at runtime.

### 👇 Secret references syntax
Use special URIs like:

```
op://<Vault>/<Item>/<Field>
```

Example in a `.env`-style file:

```
DB_USER="op://Dev/AppDB/credentials/username"
DB_PASSWORD="op://Dev/AppDB/credentials/password"
``` citeturn0search7

---

## 🚀 3) `op run`: Run commands with secrets injected

`op run` will:

1. Scan your environment (or a provided `.env` file) for secret references.
2. Fetch the real values from 1Password.
3. Run your command in a subprocess with those values set as real environment variables.

Example:

```bash
# assumes .env contains secret references
op run --env-file=".env" -- myapp
```

During execution, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, etc. will have real values. After the process exits, they disappear from the environment. citeturn0search2

You can add `--no-masking` to show values unmasked for debugging.

---

## 🧪 4) Alternatives & helpers

### 📌 `op read`
Print a secret to stdout, e.g.:

```bash
export API_KEY=$(op read "op://Private/API_KEY/password")
```

This lets you manually export a variable right now. citeturn0search27

---

## 🧠 Why this matters

- **No plaintext .env files** — secrets live in 1Password.  
- **Secure runtime only** — values only exist while your app runs.  
- **Team workflows** — secret references allow shared workflows without exposing keys. citeturn0search3

## 🧩 New beta: 1Password Environments
1Password now offers **Environments** that let you store variables like traditional `.env` configs securely, with local `.env`-file mounting and sync features. citeturn0search3

If you want, I can give real examples for your stack (Node, Python, Docker, etc.) — just tell me your environment.
