tanstack store worth it?

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — here’s a concise, fact-based evaluation of **TanStack Store** and whether it’s worth using for your projects:

### ↳ What TanStack Store *is*
- A **framework-agnostic reactive data store** with adapters for React, Vue, Angular, Solid, Svelte, etc. citeturn0search1turn0search14
- Tiny bundle size and fine-grained updates (signals-style reactivity). citeturn0search7
- Designed to work well with other **TanStack libs** like Router, Form, Query. citeturn0search1

### 👍 Strengths
**1) Lightweight & pragmatic state management**  
- Much less boilerplate than Redux and similar heavy stores. citeturn0search7  
- Fine-grained subscriptions help minimize unnecessary re-renders. citeturn0search7

**2) Framework agnostic**  
- If you work across stacks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.), one store API can work everywhere. citeturn0search1

**3) Strong ecosystem integration**  
- Powers internal state in other TanStack libraries and fits well if you already use them. citeturn0search1

**4) Good dev experience**  
- Simple API, type-safe with TypeScript, signal-style reactivity is modern and efficient. citeturn0search7

### 👎 Limitations / Risks
**1) Not yet as battle-tested as older state managers**  
- Feedback from devs suggests it’s promising but still rough in some advanced scenarios. citeturn0search0

**2) Still evolving tooling/documentation**  
- Community code-tips and GitHub discussions indicate gaps in ergonomics/devtools when stores get complex. citeturn0search13

**3) Not a server sync/data solution**  
- If you need offline sync or real-time database features, look at **TanStack DB** or other tools — Store itself is just client state. citeturn0search20

### 👉 When it *is* worth it
Use TanStack Store if you:
- Want a **modern, lightweight state manager** without Redux/Zustand complexity.
- Are already adopting other TanStack libraries (Query, Router, Form).
- Build apps where fine-grained reactive updates matter.

### 👉 When to consider alternatives
- You need **robust real-time sync**, offline persistence, or complex client–server state patterns — TanStack DB or other database/state solutions may be better. citeturn0search20
- Your team relies on established tooling with mature ecosystem/devtools.

**Summary:** TanStack Store is *worth trying* for modern front-end state management when you value simplicity, performance, and tight ecosystem integration. It’s less proven than legacy solutions, so weigh risks for mission-critical apps.

we have query and virtual and table and pacer and were on next.js

## Assistant

Short answer for your **Next.js + TanStack Query/Virtual/Table/Pacer** stack:

**Yes — TanStack Store in that context *can be worth it*** — but only if you actually need it for client state that isn’t already covered by your existing tools.

### 🔹 What you already have covered
You’ve got:
- **TanStack Query** — Great for **server state** (fetching, caching, mutations, background sync). This alone replaces most “global state” needs tied to server data. citeturn0search2
- **Virtual & Table** — For list virtualization and table UI logic. That doesn’t overlap with global state. (UI libs, not stores)
- **Pacer** — Scheduler/time-based coordination (not state management per se)

So the only remaining use case for a global store is **client-only state**:
- UI state (modals, filters, open/closed toggles)
- Cross-component state that isn’t tied to a server fetch
- Derived state that needs to be reactive outside of the Query cache

### 🔹 What TanStack Store gives you
- **Fine-grained reactivity** and minimal re-renders — similar to `useState` but shared globally
- **Type-safe, minimal boilerplate** store API  
- Works with your existing TanStack ecosystem (Router/Query/etc.)

If you *don’t* need to sync lots of client state or complex workflows, Query covers most real state you already have. citeturn0search2

### 🔹 When it adds actual value
Use TanStack Store if:
- You have **non-server state** shared widely (e.g., navigation UI, persistent toggles, client filtering criteria)
- You want **fine-grained reactivity** without the overhead of context providers or massive Zustand/Redux stores
- You prefer **tight integration** with the TanStack ecosystem and reactive patterns

### 🔹 When it *isn’t* worth it
Skip Store if your state needs are:
- Mostly server state (handled by Query)
- Simple local state that lives inside specific components
- Already managed with lightweight local state or minimal context

### 🧠 Practical rule of thumb
> In a Next.js app with **TanStack Query** as your primary data layer, you often *don’t* need a separate store unless your client state is non-trivial. If you’ve reached patterns with passing props/context or many disparate `useState`s to manage shared UI state — that’s when TanStack Store becomes worthwhile.

(short version: it’s worth using **only if** you have non-server state that needs global/reactive handling)

we use react hook form

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — given **you use React Hook Form**, here’s the clean, factual answer:

### Bottom line
**You almost certainly do *not* need TanStack Store.**

### Why (with your exact stack)
- **entity["organization","React Hook Form","react form library"]** already handles:
  - Local + complex form state
  - Field-level subscriptions (very fine-grained, minimal re-renders)
  - Derived state, validation, dirty/touched flags  
- **entity["organization","TanStack Query","react query library"]** handles:
  - Server state, caching, background updates, mutations
- **TanStack Table / Virtual / Pacer**:
  - UI logic + scheduling, not global state concerns

This means:
👉 **Forms ≠ global state problem**  
👉 **Server data ≠ global state problem**

Both are already solved *better* than a generic store would.

### When TanStack Store would still make sense
Only add **entity["organization","TanStack Store","state management library"]** if you have:
- Cross-page **UI state not tied to forms or server data**
  - app-wide filters
  - layout mode, feature flags, client-only workflow state
- State that must be shared **outside React trees** or subscribed to very selectively

If you’re not clearly feeling pain from:
- prop drilling
- context sprawl
- duplicated UI state

→ adding a store is **pure overhead**.

### Practical guidance
> With **React Hook Form + TanStack Query**, most apps do best with **zero global client store**.

If you *do* add one later, TanStack Store is a reasonable choice **because you’re already all-in on TanStack** — but it’s an optimization, not a requirement.

If you want, I can sanity-check **one concrete state example** and tell you exactly whether it belongs in:
- RHF
- Query
- local component state
- or a store

We use neon.

Any advantage to moving to singlestore?

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — **yes, there can be advantages**, but it’s only “worth it” if your workload is drifting from **Postgres app DB** toward **high-throughput realtime analytics / HTAP**.

## Where Neon is usually the right call
Neon’s core value is **serverless Postgres**: compute/storage separation, fast/elastic compute, and Postgres compatibility (extensions, ecosystem, SQL semantics). citeturn0search0turn0search4  
If your app is mostly OLTP (typical SaaS), Neon is hard to beat on simplicity.

## What you gain with SingleStore
SingleStore’s real advantages are when you need **distributed scale + analytics speed** in one system:
- **HTAP engine (rowstore + columnstore)**: better for “serve users + run analytics” on the same dataset without shipping to a warehouse. citeturn0search1turn0search5
- **High concurrency + heavy ingest**: often shines for event streams, metrics, clickstream, realtime dashboards, and large aggregates. citeturn0search1turn0search15
- **Scale-out architecture** (aggregators/leaves) designed for distributed execution. citeturn0search15

## The big tradeoff (often the deal-breaker)
**SingleStore is not Postgres.** It’s generally **MySQL-compatible** (dialect/feature differences), so you can’t assume Postgres extensions/functions and behaviors carry over cleanly. Migration effort and ongoing “dialect tax” can be real. citeturn0search9turn0search1

## Cost model reality check
Both are usage-based, but shaped differently:
- Neon: priced in **CU-hours + GB-month storage**, usage-based. citeturn0search2turn0search16
- SingleStore Helios: priced in **credits while running + storage GB-month**; credits only stop when compute stops. citeturn0search7turn0search11  
So if you benefit from **scale-to-zero / spiky workloads**, Neon can be structurally cheaper/easier. If you need **always-on high throughput**, SingleStore may justify cost via performance.

## A simple decision rule
Move to SingleStore if you have **at least one** of these today:
- realtime analytics queries are hurting prod (big GROUP BYs, dashboards, rolling windows)
- very high ingest (events/telemetry) + you need fast queries immediately
- you’re hitting single-node Postgres limits and actually need **distributed SQL**

Stay on Neon if:
- your bottleneck is typical OLTP (indexes, query tuning, caching)
- you rely on Postgres extensions / Postgres-specific SQL
- your workload is spiky and you value serverless elasticity

If you tell me (1) your rough data size + growth, (2) top 3 slowest query patterns, and (3) ingest rate (rows/sec), I’ll give you a clear “stay vs move” call and, if “move,” the lowest-risk path (often: keep Neon for OLTP, replicate into SingleStore/warehouse for analytics).
