## Assistant

To create a Gmail app password:

1. Turn on 2-Step Verification in your Google account. App passwords are unavailable without it. citeturn0search0turn0search5
2. Go to the Google App Passwords page:  
   urlGoogle App Passwordshttps://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Sign in.
4. Enter a custom name (for example: "Jovie SMTP" or "Nodemailer").
5. Click **Generate**.
6. Google will give you a 16-character password. Copy it immediately. You won't be able to view it again later. citeturn0search5turn0search7

For SMTP:

- Username: your full Gmail address
- Password: the 16-character app password
- SMTP Host: `smtp.gmail.com`
- Port: `587` (TLS) or `465` (SSL)

If the **App Passwords** option does not appear:
- Verify 2-Step Verification is enabled.
- Advanced Protection disables app passwords.
- Some Google Workspace admins block them. citeturn0search5turn0search4
