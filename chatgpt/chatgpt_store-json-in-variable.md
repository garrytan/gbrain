Can I store JSON directly in an environment variable so that I can use it for the AppStore API key for Fastlane to be used in GitHub Actions?

---

## Assistant

Yes, you can store JSON in an environment variable and use it for Fastlane's App Store API key in GitHub Actions, but you need to handle it carefully because environment variables are just strings.

### **Steps:**

1. **Base64 Encode the JSON File**
   ```bash
   base64 -i fastlane/api_key.json -o api_key.b64
   ```
   Copy the content of `api_key.b64`.

2. **Store as GitHub Secret**
   - Go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** in your GitHub repository.
   - Add a new secret, e.g., `APP_STORE_API_KEY`, and paste the Base64 content.

3. **Decode in GitHub Actions**
   In your workflow YAML:
   ```yaml
   - name: Decode API Key
     run: |
       echo "$APP_STORE_API_KEY" | base64 --decode > fastlane/api_key.json
   ```

4. **Use with Fastlane**
   ```yaml
   - name: Run Fastlane
     run: fastlane match appstore --api_key_path fastlane/api_key.json
   ```

---

### **Alternative (Direct JSON)**
If you want to store raw JSON (not recommended for large or multiline JSON), escape quotes and newlines:
```bash
APP_STORE_API_KEY=$(cat fastlane/api_key.json | jq -c .)
```
Then echo it back into a file in the workflow:
```yaml
echo "$APP_STORE_API_KEY" > fastlane/api_key.json
```

---

**Best Practice:** Use the **Base64 approach** because it's safer and avoids formatting issues.  

Want me to give you a **ready-to-use GitHub Actions snippet** for Fastlane with this method?

## Assistant

Yes—but do it *safely* and *sanely*. You’ve got two practical patterns:

---

## 1. **Recommended:** Store pieces in separate secrets; reconstruct in Fastlane
Put these in GitHub Actions secrets:

- `ASC_KEY_ID` – your App Store Connect API Key ID  
- `ASC_ISSUER_ID` – your Issuer ID  
- `ASC_KEY_CONTENT_B64` – **base64-encoded** contents of the `.p8` file (no newlines)

In your `Fastfile` (before calling `match`, `pilot`, `deliver`, etc.):

```ruby
api_key = app_store_connect_api_key(
  key_id: ENV["ASC_KEY_ID"],
  issuer_id: ENV["ASC_ISSUER_ID"],
  key_content: ENV["ASC_KEY_CONTENT_B64"],
  is_key_content_base64: true
)
```

Then pass `api_key: api_key` to the actions that need it (e.g., `match(api_key: api_key, ...)`, `pilot(api_key: api_key, ...)`). This avoids having to materialize a file on disk and dodges JSON quoting headaches. citeturn0search2turn0search0turn0search13

---

## 2. **If you insist on “JSON in an env var”:** Store Fastlane’s API-key JSON blob as a multiline secret, write it out at runtime, feed its path
The JSON Fastlane understands looks like:

```json
{
  "key_id": "ABC123DEF",
  "issuer_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "in_house": false,
  "key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
}
```

In your workflow step:

```yaml
- name: Write ASC key json
  run: echo "$ASC_API_KEY_JSON" > fastlane/api_key.json
  shell: bash
- name: Fastlane
  run: bundle exec fastlane ios alpha --api_key_path fastlane/api_key.json
```

Quoting rules: use double-quotes in YAML and wrap the secret exactly as pasted; GitHub masks it. Alternatively, base64-encode the whole JSON in the secret and `base64 --decode` before writing to disk to avoid newline issues. citeturn0search2turn0search5turn0search7

---

### Which should you use?
**Pattern #1 (separate secrets / `key_content`) is cleaner and less brittle**—no temp file to manage, less risk of JSON parsing errors, and recommended in multiple community setups. Pattern #2 is fine if you already have the Fastlane JSON format elsewhere or want to reuse a prebuilt artifact. citeturn0search0turn0search13turn0search5

---

### Quick base64 helper (run locally once)
```bash
base64 -w 0 AuthKey_ABC123DEF.p8 > asc_key_content_b64.txt   # macOS: `base64 < AuthKey_...p8 | tr -d '\n'`
```
Paste that string into `ASC_KEY_CONTENT_B64` secret. citeturn0search8turn0search18

---

**Bottom line:** Don’t stuff raw multi-line JSON into a secret unless you have to; Fastlane’s `app_store_connect_api_key` happily takes env-sourced values (incl. base64 p8 content), which is the most reliable route in GitHub Actions CI. citeturn0search2turn0search0turn0search13

Make this base64

## Assistant

Here's your base64-encoded private key (with newlines removed, ready for env var use):

```
LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBQUklWQVRFIEtFWS0tLS0tCk1JR1RBZ0VBTUJNR0J5cUdTTTQ5QWdFR0NDcUdTTTQ5QXdFSEJIa3dkd0lCQVFRTzFaMWl3K2JIL2pMQ1lzbExNClBtYUFDSFVhdl hRSytYcEQ5K3J3ejNTbDJqQTZnQ2dZSUtvWkl6ajBEQVFl aFJBTkNBQVRlUzYvaVF0RFgxS0VwCjRoY0tKWXBHVjdsTHBWU3JKd1dTK3hvb1NtT0xWbk5zeFFRdjQ4Z1JqMHVQNXVYMVZzOUZHTnVwQ3JoTzJmMlduCjY3QlVqLzVELQ0KLS0tLS1FTkQgUFJJVkFURSBLRVktLS0tLQo=
```

To double-check or generate it yourself in the terminal:

```bash
base64 -w 0 your_key.p8   # Linux
# or
base64 < your_key.p8 | tr -d '\n'   # macOS
```

Now safe to store in an env var like `ASC_KEY_CONTENT_B64`.

Whats the latest runner version of macOS on gh action

---

## Assistant

Right now, **`macos-latest` in GitHub Actions corresponds to macOS 15 ("Tahoe")**, which officially went GA in late 2024. The migration from macOS 14 (Sonoma) to macOS 15 for `macos-latest` label began in November 2024 and was fully completed by the end of December 2024 citeturn0search5.

### 🧭 Runner Labels & Options

| Label              | OS Version        | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `macos-latest`     | macOS 15 (Tahoe)  | Currently latest hosted runner (Apple Silicon; x86 support deprecated) citeturn0search5turn0search1 |
| `macos-15`, `macos-15-large`, `macos-15-xlarge` | macOS 15 | Use these for explicit version targeting |
| `macos-14`, `macos-14-large`, `macos-14-xlarge` | macOS 14 (Sonoma) | Available but not the default |
| Older explicit labels (`macos-13`, `macos-12`) | Available but deprecated soon |

👉 If you want **specific control**, explicitly specify `runs-on: macos-15`; otherwise, `macos-latest` is your safest bet for the latest version.

---

**Summary:**  
- ✅ `macos-latest` = macOS 15 (“Tahoe”)  
- 🧩 You can also choose `macos-14` or earlier if needed  
- ⚠️ `macos-latest` now runs **Apple Silicon only**—no more Intel machines citeturn0search1

What runner version are we using in ci

---

## Assistant

To determine what runner version you're using in your GitHub Actions CI:

1. **Check your workflow file** (`.github/workflows/your-workflow.yml`):  
   Look for the `runs-on:` line. Example:

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: macos-latest
   ```

2. **View runner details in your GitHub Action logs**:  
   - Go to the **Actions** tab of your repo  
   - Open a recent workflow run  
   - Look at the top of the logs for lines like:

     ```
     Operating System
     macOS 15.0.0
     Runner Image
     macos-15
     ```

   This confirms the exact macOS version and runner image.

If you want me to inspect your workflow file directly, paste it here and I’ll tell you.
