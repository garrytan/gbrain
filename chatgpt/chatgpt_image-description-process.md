## Audit report for urlJoviehttps://jov.ie

### 1) Executive summary
Overall, the dashboard experience feels feature-rich but uneven in completeness and polish. The biggest risks are entire core sections showing as essentially empty (Calendar, Tasks), data/copy inconsistencies that erode trust (Library counts, Growth percentages), and tables that render misaligned/partial rows (Audience, People). The strongest areas are the command palette’s quick search/filtering and the breadth of admin visibility. The weakest are core user flows that lack meaningful content/empty states, and operational dashboards with confusing metrics.

- Features exercised: command palette search, release list, audience list, admin KPIs, settings navigation
- Viewports tested: desktop only
- States observed: “Loading Library” text (persisting), empty sections (Calendar/Tasks), horizontal tables
- Areas not reached (time-limited): remaining settings tabs (Billing/Data Privacy/Contacts/Touring/Analytics/Audience & Tracking/Admin), attachment/dictation flows, destructive flows, admin “Screenshots” and “Share studio”, deeper admin detail dialogs, mobile/tablet responsiveness

### 3) Top 10 issues (by impact)
1. Calendar page renders only a heading with no calendar UI or empty-state guidance.
2. Tasks page renders only a heading with no task table/list or empty-state guidance despite a 99+ badge.
3. Growth pipeline shows impossible “100%” disqualified/rejected percentages, undermining metric credibility.
4. Library “Needs Assets” count equals total releases, conflicting with “Ready Assets” count (makes counts useless).
5. Audience table rows are inconsistent (emails/status missing on some rows), creating alignment and comprehension problems.
6. People (waitlist) table header is confusing (“Primary Social / Spotify” jammed) and relies on horizontal scroll for basic comprehension.
7. Library page shows “Loading Library” and “Library” together and “51” repeated multiple times, adding noise.
8. Profile/settings layout includes redundant headings (“Artist” then “Profile”) and lacks an obvious save/auto-save confirmation state.
9. Many icon-only admin actions lack visible labels (buttons rely on aria-label); keyboard/focus discoverability is unclear.
10. Platform connections copy is circular and vague (“Connect Spotify in Admin → Platform Connections”), adding friction.

### 4) Full issue list (structured)
#### Issue 001
- Title: Calendar section is effectively empty
- Severity: High
- Category: UX / Empty state / Navigation
- Location: urlhttps://jov.ie/app/calendarhttps://jov.ie/app/calendar
- User goal impacted: Plan/see calendar events
- What happened: Page shows only “Calendar” with no UI, content, or next step.
- What I expected: Calendar grid/list, “add event” CTA, and meaningful empty state.
- Why it matters: Feels unfinished; blocks a core planning use case.
- Repro: Open Calendar from left nav.
- Suggested fix: Implement calendar UI; add empty state with a clear CTA.

#### Issue 002
- Title: Tasks section is effectively empty despite badge “99+”
- Severity: Critical
- Category: UX / Empty state / Reliability
- Location: urlhttps://jov.ie/app/taskshttps://jov.ie/app/tasks
- User goal impacted: Track work; see tasks
- What happened: Only “Tasks” heading appears; no tasks list/table/filters/empty-state guidance.
- What I expected: Task view with filters/columns and an empty state, or a clear error if loading fails.
- Why it matters: Task tracking is implied to be heavily used (badge 99+); this looks broken and undermines trust.
- Repro: Open Tasks from left nav.
- Suggested fix: Render task list; if no data, show empty state; if loading fails, surface a clear error state.

#### Issue 003
- Title: Growth pipeline shows impossible percentage values
- Severity: High
- Category: Copy / Data integrity / UI
- Location: urlhttps://jov.ie/app/admin/growthhttps://jov.ie/app/admin/growth
- User goal impacted: Understand pipeline conversion
- What happened: “361 disqualified (100%)” and “1 rejected (100%)” show 100% in a way that appears incorrect given totals.
- What I expected: Percentages that reflect shares of relevant totals, plus label/context.
- Why it matters: KPI dashboards must be trustworthy; bad math destroys credibility fast.
- Repro: Open Growth; read Pipeline Scan.
- Suggested fix: Correct percentage logic and clarify denominators (e.g., “361 disqualified (65.5% of discovered)”).

#### Issue 004
- Title: Library view counts conflict (Needs Assets vs Ready Assets vs total)
- Severity: Medium
- Category: Copy / Data integrity / UX
- Location: urlhttps://jov.ie/app/libraryhttps://jov.ie/app/library
- User goal impacted: Prioritize asset work
- What happened: “All Releases 51”, “Ready Assets 19”, “Needs Assets 51”.
- What I expected: Needs Assets = All Releases − Ready Assets (or at least consistent logic).
- Why it matters: If counts don’t reconcile, users can’t trust filtering or plan work.
- Repro: Open Library; read view counts.
- Suggested fix: Fix counts; show clear definitions per tab; ensure totals reconcile.

#### Issue 005
- Title: Audience table renders inconsistent row structures and duplicate city labels
- Severity: Medium
- Category: UI / Data integrity / UX
- Location: urlhttps://jov.ie/app/audiencehttps://jov.ie/app/audience
- User goal impacted: Scan audience list quickly
- What happened: Some rows omit email/status fields; “Fan/Action” header doesn’t match visible columns; cities list includes duplicates (e.g., “Los Angeles” twice).
- What I expected: Stable row structure, clear columns, and deduped city summaries.
- Why it matters: Misalignment reduces comprehension; duplicates make summaries unreliable.
- Repro: Open Audience; scan table and Cities summary.
- Suggested fix: Enforce consistent row schema; explicitly label columns; dedupe/aggregate in summaries.

#### Issue 006
- Title: People (waitlist) table header and horizontal scroll reduce clarity
- Severity: Low
- Category: UX / UI / Accessibility
- Location: urlhttps://jov.ie/app/admin/peoplehttps://jov.ie/app/admin/people (Waitlist view)
- User goal impacted: View waitlist details without guessing columns
- What happened: Header packs “Primary Social” and “Spotify” together awkwardly; content requires horizontal scroll for basic comprehension.
- What I expected: Clear column separation and responsive layout.
- Why it matters: Admin tables need quick scanning; horizontal scroll is heavy friction.
- Repro: Open People → Waitlist; examine header and scroll.
- Suggested fix: Split columns clearly; make table responsive; add column labels that match row contents.

#### Issue 007
- Title: Library header contains noisy, repetitive “Loading Library” / “Library” text and repeated counts
- Severity: Polish
- Category: Copy / Visual design
- Location: urlhttps://jov.ie/app/libraryhttps://jov.ie/app/library
- User goal impacted: Quickly understand state
- What happened: Shows “Loading Library” then “Library”, plus multiple “51” labels.
- What I expected: Single clear title and one source-of-truth count display.
- Why it matters: Noise makes the app feel unpolished and confusing.
- Repro: Open Library.
- Suggested fix: Remove redundant text and duplicate counts; show one clear title and one count summary.

#### Issue 008
- Title: Profile/settings layout is redundant and lacks explicit save/confirmation behavior
- Severity: Low
- Category: UX / Copy / Reliability
- Location: urlhttps://jov.ie/app/settings/artist-profilehttps://jov.ie/app/settings/artist-profile
- User goal impacted: Edit profile confidently
- What happened: Repeated headings (“Artist” then “Profile” describing similar concepts); unclear whether changes auto-save or need explicit save; no obvious confirmation state.
- What I expected: A single coherent section title and explicit save/auto-save feedback.
- Why it matters: Editing identity info needs clarity and trust.
- Repro: Open Profile settings; scroll through.
- Suggested fix: Remove redundant headings; add persistent save bar or “All changes saved” feedback.

#### Issue 009
- Title: Icon-only admin actions lack visible labels; discoverability depends on aria-label
- Severity: Accessibility
- Category: Accessibility / UX
- Location: multiple admin pages, e.g., urlhttps://jov.ie/app/audiencehttps://jov.ie/app/audience and urlhttps://jov.ie/app/admin/platform-connectionshttps://jov.ie/app/admin/platform-connections
- User goal impacted: Understand actions without hovering or guessing
- What happened: Buttons show icons only (e.g., “Source link actions”, “Close analytics panel”), likely fine for screen readers but poor for quick scanning.
- What I expected: Text label or tooltip for sighted users, visible focus indicator.
- Why it matters: Keyboard-only and low-vision discoverability suffers.
- Repro: Open Audience; look at top controls; tab through.
- Suggested fix: Add tooltips and visible focus styling; consider text labels for key actions.

#### Issue 010
- Title: Platform connections copy is circular and vague
- Severity: Low
- Category: Copy / UX
- Location: urlhttps://jov.ie/app/admin/platform-connectionshttps://jov.ie/app/admin/platform-connections
- User goal impacted: Connect urlSpotifyhttps://www.spotify.com publisher
- What happened: “Connect Spotify in Admin → Platform Connections” points to the page the user is already on; “Active Publisher Not set Never updated” lacks clarity.
- What I expected: Step-by-step instructions and a clear next action.
- Why it matters: Setup friction can prevent adoption.
- Repro: Open Platform Connections.
- Suggested fix: Replace circular copy with actionable steps and clearer status descriptions.

### 5) Performance and jank findings
- Perceived performance: generally snappy route changes, but Library feels heavy due to very long scroll and repeated noisy labels.
- State handling: Calendar/Tasks feel like “blank load” with no skeleton/empty state, which reads as broken.
- No obvious layout shift noted in the tested paths beyond long-content scroll.

### 6) Copy audit findings
- “361 disqualified (100%)” and “1 rejected (100%)” are misleading; fix math and add context.
- “Connect Spotify in Admin → Platform Connections” is circular; replace with a direct instruction like “Click Connect Spotify below.”
- “Loading Library” + “Library” + repeated “51” adds noise; simplify.
- “Ops”/“Growth” sections read like internal tool jargon; add user-friendly context where possible.

### 7) Design-system consistency findings
- Tables often use button elements for headers/cells inconsistently (some headers are buttons, some are plain text).
- Many admin controls are icon-only without consistent visible labels.
- Navigation alternates between “Back to App” links and full sidebar layouts; consider consistency in shell/navigation patterns.

### 8) Accessibility findings
- Icon-only buttons depend on aria-labels (good for screen readers) but lack sighted discoverability; tooltips and focus states should be verified and improved.
- Multiple tables require horizontal scroll, which is hard for keyboard users unless careful focus management is implemented.
- Command palette works well with Esc close and filtering; ensure keyboard selection is obvious.

### 9) Navigation and route findings
- Sidebar navigation highlights current section correctly (where tested).
- Library and settings routes use a “Back to App” link rather than keeping the sidebar visible; state persistence when leaving Library (filters/selection) is unclear.
- Query-parameter tabs exist in People/Platform Connections, which is good for deep links.

### 10) Screenshots index
- Chat/home baseline state, showing main shell and navigation: 【267565677026786†screenshot】

### 11) Product-quality recommendations (prioritized)
1. Fix Calendar and Tasks to show real content or strong empty states (with CTAs) so core flows don’t look broken.
2. Correct KPI math and label clarity in Growth and Admin dashboards; trust is the primary value of these pages.
3. Reconcile counts in Library and reduce header noise.
4. Stabilize table schemas (Audience/People) to prevent misalignment and partial rows.
5. Improve discoverability for icon-only actions with tooltips and visible focus states.

### 12) Retest checklist
- Calendar shows calendar UI and/or a guided empty state.
- Tasks shows tasks list/table with accurate badge counts and empty/loading/error states.
- Growth percentages are accurate and labeled clearly.
- Library counts reconcile and “Loading Library” noise removed.
- Audience rows are consistent and cities summary deduped.
- Icon-only buttons have tooltips and visible focus states.
