## User

can i talk to hermes and have hermes talk back over audio

---

## Assistant

Yes. urlHermes Agenthttps://github.com/Entropy-RLAI/Hermes-Agent is basically just an orchestration layer. You can put voice I/O in front of it.

The stack is straightforward:

- Speech-to-text (your voice → text)
- Hermes agent loop (reasoning + tool use)
- Text-to-speech (response → audio)

Good low-latency setup:

- STT: urlOpenAI Realtime API Docshttps://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime or Whisper.cpp locally
- Orchestrator: Hermes
- TTS: urlElevenLabshttps://elevenlabs.io, OpenAI Realtime voice, or Kokoro locally
- Wake word / continuous listening: VAD + push-to-talk

For your workflow specifically, the interesting part is not “voice assistant.” It’s ambient ops.

Example:

- “Hermes, run nightly QA on onboarding.”
- Hermes spins up Codex/Claude subagents.
- Reads CI failures aloud.
- “Three Playwright failures on artist profile mobile.”
- You reply verbally:
  - “Open worktree and patch the hydration issue.”
- Hermes executes.

That becomes effectively:
- AI CTO + NOC operator + QA lead
- entirely voice driven while you’re walking/driving/gym/etc.

You could also:
- have Hermes verbally summarize repo state every morning
- read Sentry regressions
- announce deploy failures
- tell you when limits reset
- narrate GTM scraper health
- alert when ingestion stalls
- verbally review PR diffs

Architecture I’d recommend for Jovie:

```text
Mic
 ↓
Realtime STT
 ↓
Session router
 ↓
Hermes orchestrator
 ↓
Subagents (Codex / Claude / local models)
 ↓
Tool calls (GitHub, Linear, Airtable, CI, shell)
 ↓
Realtime TTS
 ↓
Speaker
```

For speed/cost:

- Local:
  - Whisper.cpp
  - Kokoro TTS
  - Hermes orchestration
  - Qwen/DeepSeek locally for lightweight tasks

- Cloud:
  - Claude/Codex only for hard reasoning/coding
  - Realtime API only during active conversation

This is where the industry is heading:
- voice-native agent orchestration
- continuous background ops
- ambient software engineering

Your advantage is Jovie is already agent-heavy. Voice becomes another interface layer, not a separate product.

## User

cost if i did this for 8 hours a day

---

## Assistant

Depends entirely on whether you do:
- cloud realtime voice
- local STT/TTS
- how much reasoning is happening continuously

Three realistic tiers:

## 1. Cheap / practical hybrid — probably optimal

Architecture:
- Local Whisper.cpp STT
- Local Kokoro TTS
- Hermes locally
- Claude/Codex only when actual work is needed

Idle listening:
- basically free

Active coding/reasoning:
- same costs you already incur with Claude/Codex subscriptions

Estimated:
- ~$0–10/day incremental
- mostly electricity + occasional API calls

This is likely the sweet spot for Jovie ops.

---

## 2. Full OpenAI Realtime voice all day

Using:
- continuous streaming audio in/out
- GPT realtime model
- live conversational loop

8 hours/day can get expensive because audio tokens accumulate constantly.

Rough estimate:
- ~$15–80/day
- ~$450–2400/month

Depends on:
- silence handling
- VAD aggressiveness
- whether mic streams continuously
- verbosity of responses

Continuous open mic is the killer.

---

## 3. Fully local

Mac Studio / 4090 box:
- Whisper.cpp
- Kokoro/Piper
- Hermes
- local Qwen/DeepSeek

Cost:
- near zero marginal cost
- just hardware + electricity

Electricity:
- maybe $20–80/month depending on GPU usage

But:
- weaker reasoning than Claude/Codex for frontier SWE tasks
- fantastic for orchestration though

---

For your use case, the economically correct architecture is probably:

```text
Always-on local layer:
- wake word
- STT
- TTS
- orchestration
- lightweight reasoning

Burst-to-cloud:
- Claude Code
- Codex
- Opus
- GPT-5.x
only when needed
```

That gets you:
- near-zero idle cost
- frontier intelligence on demand
- 24/7 ambient ops

The key insight:
You do not want frontier models “thinking” continuously for 8 hours.

You want:
- cheap always-on monitoring
- expensive intelligence only on escalation

Exactly like modern cloud infrastructure:
- lightweight monitoring everywhere
- expensive compute only when triggered.

## User

i have whisperflow

---

## Assistant

urlWhisperFlowhttps://github.com/WhisperFlow/WhisperFlow already solves a large chunk of this stack for you.

You can realistically build:

```text id="pkr0cl"
WhisperFlow
  ↓
Hermes orchestration
  ↓
Claude Code / Codex / local agents
  ↓
Kokoro or ElevenLabs TTS
```

That means:

- local low-latency transcription
- continuous listening
- push-to-talk or wake word
- near-zero idle cost
- Hermes receives structured text commands
- Hermes can speak responses back

For your setup specifically, I would avoid making Hermes “chatty.”

You want:
- terse ops responses
- auditory dashboards
- escalation summaries
- confirmations only when needed

Example:

You:
- “Hermes, check GTM ingestion health.”

Hermes:
- “Three scraper failures. Spotify parser changed. Queue backlog at 812 jobs.”

You:
- “Patch it with Codex and open a PR.”

Hermes:
- “Launching worktree.”

That is dramatically more useful than full conversational assistant behavior.

Recommended architecture:

```text id="c3a2m2"
WhisperFlow
- VAD
- STT
- wake word

↓ websocket/stdin

Hermes
- orchestration
- routing
- memory
- tool execution

↓ dispatch

Agents
- Claude Code
- Codex
- local Qwen
- local DeepSeek

↓ output

TTS
- Kokoro local
or
- ElevenLabs cloud
```

For TTS:
- Kokoro = cheap/local/fast
- ElevenLabs = best quality
- OpenAI realtime = easiest integrated stack

For your “move fast” requirement:
- WhisperFlow + Hermes + Kokoro locally
- burst Claude/Codex only for real work
- run permanently on a Mac Mini or Linux box

That gets you:
- always-on AI ops
- essentially negligible idle costs
- voice-commanded engineering
- continuous repo supervision

This is probably a better ROI than trying to make every agent smarter individually. The compounding gain is reducing friction between your brain and orchestration.

## User

how mcuh with just eleven labs for output

---

## Assistant

If you already have local WhisperFlow handling input, then ElevenLabs is only paying for output audio generation.

That becomes surprisingly cheap.

Rule of thumb:

- conversational assistant speaking normally:
  - ~100–150 words/minute
- 8 hours/day does NOT mean 8 hours of generated speech
- realistically you’d probably generate:
  - 30–120 minutes/day of actual TTS audio

At current pricing, that’s roughly:

| Usage Pattern | Estimated Cost |
|---|---:|
| Light ops responses (15–30 min/day speech) | ~$5–15/month |
| Heavy interactive use (1–2 hrs/day speech) | ~$20–80/month |
| Extremely chatty continuous assistant | ~$100–300+/month |

The important thing:
TTS is cheap.
Continuous realtime reasoning is expensive.

With your setup:

```text id="jfw7c4"
WhisperFlow (local STT)
↓
Hermes
↓
Claude/Codex only when needed
↓
ElevenLabs TTS output
```

…your marginal cost is mostly:
- Claude/Codex usage
- not ElevenLabs speech

You could probably run “Hermes talking back all day” for less than your current AI coding spend. Especially if responses are concise ops-style summaries instead of long conversational monologues. citeturn0search1turn0search3turn0search5

## User

can i use my codex subscription for it

---

## Assistant

Yes, mostly.

Your ChatGPT Pro/Plus Codex subscription can absolutely power the “thinking/coding/orchestration” layer of this setup. citeturn0search0turn0search23turn0search26

The key distinction:

| Component | Covered by Codex subscription? |
|---|---|
| Codex coding agent | Yes |
| Codex CLI / app usage | Yes, within limits |
| Long-running agent sessions | Yes, within limits |
| Voice input (WhisperFlow) | No, but local/free |
| ElevenLabs voice output | No |
| OpenAI API usage outside Codex | No |
| Always-on realtime audio APIs | No |

So your architecture could be:

```text id="v6o7j5"
WhisperFlow (local/free)
↓
Hermes
↓
Codex subscription
↓
ElevenLabs TTS
```

And that works.

The caveat:
Codex subscriptions are usage-limited. Heavy autonomous orchestration can burn limits surprisingly fast, especially with:
- large monorepos
- long context windows
- many subagents
- continuous background tasks
- cloud execution

OpenAI explicitly notes that long-running or complex coding tasks consume much more allowance. citeturn0search23turn0search9turn0search6

For your use case, the optimal strategy is probably:

## Use Codex for:
- difficult coding
- debugging
- architecture
- PR review
- implementation
- repo-wide refactors

## Use local models for:
- monitoring
- orchestration
- health checks
- summarization
- lightweight decisions
- “should I escalate this?”

That preserves your Codex budget for high-leverage work.

Otherwise Hermes can accidentally become:
- “burn $200/month narrating logs out loud.”

You want a tiered intelligence stack:

```text id="70r5ki"
Cheap local models:
- always on
- monitoring
- routing
- lightweight reasoning

Codex:
- escalations
- actual engineering
- difficult implementation
```

That is likely the highest ROI architecture for Jovie right now.
