entity["company","DeepSeek","Chinese AI company"] is currently one of the most important open-weight AI labs. Its main value proposition is delivering near-frontier model performance at dramatically lower cost than many Western competitors. citeturn0search1turn0search5

For your use case (Jovie, Hermes agents, multi-model routing), the models that matter are:

| Model | Best Use |
|---|---|
| DeepSeek V4 Flash | Fast agents, routing, chat, high-volume operations |
| DeepSeek V4 Pro | Coding, planning, architecture, complex workflows |
| DeepSeek R1 | Deep reasoning, research, debugging, strategic thinking |
| DeepSeek Coder variants | Specialized coding tasks and local deployments |

Recent V4 releases are pushing heavily into agent workflows and long-context reasoning, with up to 1M token context windows and strong coding benchmarks. citeturn0search0turn0search5turn0search7

For Jovie specifically:

- **Chief of staff / orchestration:** DeepSeek V4 Flash
- **Coding agent:** DeepSeek V4 Pro
- **Complex planning:** DeepSeek R1 or V4 Pro
- **Mass background automation:** DeepSeek Flash
- **Expensive critical decisions:** GPT-5.5 or Claude Opus as escalation models

The biggest reason founders are adopting DeepSeek right now is economics. DeepSeek recently cut V4-Pro pricing by 75%, making it one of the cheapest frontier-capable models available. citeturn0news17turn0news18

Current industry pattern is increasingly:

1. Route 80–95% of work to DeepSeek Flash/V4.
2. Escalate hard tasks to Claude, GPT, Gemini, or Kimi.
3. Use evaluation loops to determine when escalation is needed.

That is roughly the architecture Hermes, OpenRouter, and most serious agent systems are moving toward. citeturn0search8turn0news17

For pure coding value-per-dollar today, DeepSeek V4 Pro is arguably one of the strongest options available. Claude still tends to win on product intuition and UX decisions. GPT-5.5 remains strong for tool use and reliability. DeepSeek is currently the cost-performance leader. citeturn0search0turn0search5turn0news17
