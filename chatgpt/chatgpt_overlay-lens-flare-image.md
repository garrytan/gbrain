Whats a free photoshop alternative for Mac i can use to layer a lens flare and then do some basic blend modes

## Assistant

For what you want, Mr. White, these are your best **free** options on macOS:

1. **GIMP (desktop app) – closest to classic Photoshop**
   - Fully free, open-source, runs on macOS. citeturn0search11turn0search2  
   - Supports **layers**, **layer masks**, and a full set of **blend modes** (Screen, Overlay, Multiply, etc.).
   - Perfect for dropping your lens flare PNG on a new layer and setting the blend mode to *Screen* or *Add*.

2. **Pixlr E (browser or Mac app) – quick and simple**
   - Free, runs in your browser or as an app; no heavy install. citeturn0search0turn0search7  
   - Has Photoshop-style **layers and blending modes** and an interface that feels familiar if you’ve used PS.
   - Good if you just want to open an image, drag the flare on top, change blend mode, export, and bounce.

3. **Seashore (native Mac, lightweight)**
   - Free, open-source editor built specifically for macOS. citeturn0search8  
   - Supports **layers** and **layer merging effects**; simpler than GIMP, less clutter.

If you want only one:

- **Install GIMP** if you’re okay with a bit of learning curve and want maximum control.
- **Use Pixlr E** if you just want something fast for occasional censoring work.

How to scale or transform in gimp

---

## Assistant

Here’s the quick rundown for GIMP on Mac, Mr. White.

### 1. Scale / transform a **layer** (like your lens flare)

1. In the **Layers** panel, click the layer you want to transform.
2. Choose the **Scale Tool**:
   - Menu: **Tools → Transform Tools → Scale**
   - Or toolbar icon that looks like a small rectangle with an arrow.
3. Click on the canvas – a box with handles appears around the layer.
4. Drag the corners to resize  
   - To keep proportions: in the **Tool Options**, lock the chain icon between Width/Height.
5. Click **Scale** in the small dialog to apply.

For rotation, perspective, etc., same idea but use:
- **Tools → Transform Tools → Rotate / Perspective / Unified Transform**

### 2. Scale / transform a **selection** (part of a layer)

1. Make a selection (Rectangle Select, Ellipse, Free Select, etc.).
2. Choose **Tools → Transform Tools → Scale**.
3. Drag handles to reshape just that selected area.
4. Hit **Scale** to confirm.

### 3. Scale the **whole image** (not just a layer)

- Go to **Image → Scale Image…**
- Set new width/height → **Scale**.  
  (This resizes the entire document, all layers together.)

### 4. Quick tip for your lens flare overlay

1. Open base image.
2. **File → Open as Layers…** and pick the lens flare PNG.
3. With the flare layer selected:
   - Use **Scale Tool** to size it.
   - Use **Move Tool** to position it.
   - In the Layers panel, set **Mode** to **Screen**, **Addition**, or **Overlay**.
4. Export: **File → Export As…** (PNG or JPEG).

If you tell me whether you’re transforming the flare itself or the entire censored image, I can give you a one-line “do this, this, this” macro for your exact workflow.
