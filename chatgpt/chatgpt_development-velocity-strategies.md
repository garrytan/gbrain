## User

So, I'm very interested in, basically, development velocity. And so, like, there's this, you know, it's pretty well understood by good founders and Y Combinator and all that, but, you know, if you have a team that takes two weeks to ship, you know, ships in two-week cycles, right? So, they go and they have a product meeting, and then they fuckin' split up their work, and then they go and they do their work, and they come back two weeks later, and they ship what they decided they were going to work on in that product meeting, and then they repeat, and every two weeks, there's new stuff that comes out, and as that stuff comes out, they learn about it, they learn about bugs, they learn about features that people aren't using, so they can decide if they want to kill them or not, they learn about features that people are using that they weren't expecting, or using in a different way, and then they start, you know, changing and iterating on that, right? Well, it's generally, like, understood that, like, if you have a second, a different team, and they can ship every four hours, then in the time that, in the two weeks that it took team one to ship, team two has shipped 28 versions, 28 products, they've shipped 28 times, and so, you know, team one has taken one shot, team two has taken 28 shots, and each one of those is an iteration that gets closer to something that, you know, they know customers want, and customers will find super useful, and so, you know, if you're trying to bet on what team's going to win, it's going to be the team that can ship 28 times for every time the other team ships, you know? Because even if they ship the entirely wrong thing, and the other team ships a mostly right thing, with 27 iterations in that two week span, chances are that they're going to realize their mistake, correct for it, and repeatedly correct, that's not how it works, but okay, and repeatedly correct, you know, repeatedly correct and iterate on it, and so, that's my main thing, is just like, it's, you know, velocity with which you're shipping is kind of what matters here. So that being the case, I’m kind of like applying that thinking to modern coding and I’m thinking about these AI agents so we have code Jen copilot Claude Kodex and we surf cascade in cursor and all these tools and what I’m thinking is you know if I can be looking at my code business and just having an efficient orchestration system where I’m able to constantly open up issues have those and have AI agents coating you know it’s it’s basically like it comes down to like how much of the process can you automate so like right now you know I can come up with like OK this is the task we want like we’re gonna have payments with stripe or something and we need to do a stripe integration and I can basically go into you know one of these things I can watch and say OK here’s the emails and specs for the stripe integration go and build it and then I’ll go build it and I’ll open up a PR and then I have some AI code that will look at that PR and I can go in. I can say OK great there’s a PR now now look at the code of view and address the issues and then they’ll just the issues and they’ll come back and they’ll get another coder view and it’ll be a much closer to a good you know PR and you know at some point it’s acceptance and will merge it and then you know I’ll manually take notes on the things. Maybe there was a couple things that were like improvements that are minor like improvements that would be good to have, but aren’t necessarily like something that needs to be done the second in that PR we’re just like increase the scope of the PR so we might not do them but they’re good to have. I’ll take note of that and then be like OK. That’s the thing we wanna dress in the future and then I’ll add it to my list of tasks to address right and so you know and then there’s things that’ll happen like all sudden I’ll notice there’s an issue like maybe something has a type any instead of explicit types and I’ll go and fix that in the component you know and then I’ll be like well. We should probably check that across the entire code base so I need to open a task to look for that in other areas of the code base you know and then we’ll do this. I don’t check out the stripe of immigration. I’ll manually find some issues or something or we’ll need to get to the next phase or fix some bugs and so I’ll let your coat an agent a lot of times there’s like conflicts and stuff with merge complex and stuff because there’s you know agents are have coverage of the same stuff and I wanna open up. I guess my question really is like what tools and what systems are in place in out there and I know a lot of people working on this so where I can get to a point where you know if I go onto Koch‘s webinar face, I can go in and manually type out open up an issue related to you know fix our header to make it a sticky header and it’ll go spin up an environment, isolated in the cloud and they’ll start working on that and open up a PR and then I can tell it go do a stripe integration and I’ll separately open up a new isolated environment and do that and I can do that. You know I’m just sitting there typing what I’d like to get to is a place where you know 24 seven we have multiple coding agents running in parallel on our code base and you know we’re in a situation where like if there’s bugs they’re being found they’re being dealt with if you know if we add something to our guard rails an AI DJ an ad and then going and looking at the code base to make sure that everything is compliant with those guard rolls if we decide hey we want to add cashing you know we’ve got multiple agents spinning up to add cashing throughout the entire code base you know something is running to make sure that you know if some of the looking at the code reviews and say OK. These things were merged but some of the issues in the code review weren’t addressed but add that and then split up agents and how can we take as much of the Manuel work out of this so that we’re in a situation where we have more age because our ability to ship will be you know the more agents we have working in the more reliable they are and the more that they’re like kind of like automatically going through this like self check of like code review and then fixing the issues in the code review the title we can make that cycle from two weeks to one week to one day to eight hours four hours an hour to wear worship shipping you know kind of perpetually like we’re just always shipping. You know what I mean and if we can do that I can kind of step back from having to be manually orchestrating all these AI agents and really be sitting there looking at how users are using the products and worrying about that kind of stuff so my question is using you know we’re currently doing things like opening up issues in Linear and then assigning agents to them are having wind surf‘s cascade open up the issues for us and assigned things and we’ve got some CI rules and we’ve got some automated code to be own stuff but what what tools are out there that I might not be aware of what new companies is from like my commentator or just in general are working on solutions for this what what what is the best tools today that take as much of manual work out of this process that can get a certain and go and go basically is to have to be shipping in a short cycle as possible and my hypothesis is that the way to do that is to increase the amount of simultaneous or parallel, AI agents running on our code base and minimize the number of manual interventions needed with each one of those but you know maybe that maybe there’s another way maybe it’s it’s actually that we should just be using one scarf on them on a faster, Internet connection with more efficient, models, or something. I don’t know, but help me.

Mr. White — short, surgical, and practical.

# TL;DR
You’re thinking about it correctly: shrink batch size, isolate changes, and let agents run in parallel behind tight CI gates. Today’s best stack for “many agents shipping many small PRs” is:

- **Managed, end-to-end agent**: **Devin** (tickets → plan → run → tests → PR) for heavier tasks and autonomous cycles. citeturn0search0turn0search8turn0search16  
- **IDE/desktop agents that can parallelize**: **Windsurf Cascade**, **Cursor Agent mode**, **Claude Code** — all can plan multi-step edits, run terminals/tests, and open PRs. Use them concurrently on *isolated branches/worktrees*. citeturn0search10turn0search2turn0search11turn0search4  
- **Open-source / self-host**: **OpenDevin** if you want to own the infra and wire it to your CI/feature flags. citeturn0search5  
- **Note**: **Copilot Workspace** tech preview is *sunset (May 30, 2025)* — don’t depend on it. citeturn0search9

# How to run many agents safely (no human babysitting)
**Repo isolation & sharding**
- Use **`git worktree`** (or provider-level ephemeral sandboxes) to spawn *N* isolated branches per task. One agent per worktree; never share a branch. Label worktrees with task ID + feature flag. (Community patterns echo this approach.) citeturn0search3
- **Shard by ownership**: CODEOWNERS + path rules (e.g., `/apps/web/*` vs `/packages/ui/*`) to minimize conflicts. Agents only touch files in their shard unless escalated.

**CI/PR guardrails (strict)**
- Required checks to merge: unit+e2e tests, typecheck, lints, **preview build**, **feature-flag off by default**, and “risk diff” (loc/touched files). CI fails → agent must self-fix before re-attempting merge.  
- **Merge queue** on `main` (FIFO, one-at-a-time) with auto-rebase. Ship continuously; no “two-week batching.” citeturn0search7

**Ephemeral environments**
- Each agent PR deploys its own **Vercel Preview** + **Neon branch DB** + seeded fixtures. PostHog flag gates exposure. (Matches your Jovie stack norms.)

**Agent lifecycle (per task)**
1) Linear ticket → **spec** (acceptance tests, file boundaries, flag name).  
2) Agent spins worktree/branch + **writes tests first** (or golden snapshots).  
3) Implement → run scripts → fix until green → PR with **flag = off**.  
4) Reviewer bot enforces scope/size; if changes requested, same agent loops.  
5) After merge: staged rollout via PostHog flag → telemetry watch → ramp.

# Tools to wire in now (best-in-class)
- **Devin** for autonomous, heavier tickets and 24/7 backlog burn-down; integrates with Linear/Jira, plans/tests/opens PRs. Use for Stripe-scale integrations, repo migrations, multi-service chores. citeturn0search0turn0search8
- **Windsurf Cascade** inside your editor for **multi-step repo-wide edits** with curated doc awareness; great for systematic refactors guarded by flags. citeturn0search10
- **Cursor Agent mode** for “plan → edit → run → iterate until tests pass,” strong for parallel small/medium tasks. citeturn0search11
- **Claude Code** for fast codebase mapping, terminal-driven tasks, and “issue → PR” loops; strong at multi-file reasoning. citeturn0search4
- **OpenDevin (self-host)** to build your own orchestrator (useful if you want deeper control/observability and cost tuning). citeturn0search5
- **Skip**: Copilot Workspace (preview ended). citeturn0search9

# Orchestration blueprint for Jovie (fits your stack)
**Linear → Agents → GitHub → Vercel/Neon → PostHog**
- **Linear**: templates that force each ticket to declare: scope paths, test plan, flag name, expected telemetry.  
- **Dispatcher (tiny service)**: reads Linear, spins **worktrees** + tags tasks → assigns to agent pool (Devin for big; Windsurf/Cursor/Claude for small).  
- **GitHub Actions**: matrix jobs per PR (typecheck, unit, Playwright smoke, build preview). Auto-comment with preview URL + **flag instructions**.  
- **Vercel**: preview per PR; **Neon**: branch DB; **Drizzle** migrations behind a flag.  
- **PostHog**: feature flag + success KPI (click-through, conversion). Merge bot auto-enables **1% canary** only after “N minutes green + KPI ≥ threshold.”  
- **Auto-cleanup**: after merge, dispatcher closes Linear sub-tasks, opens follow-ups for “nice-to-haves” the agent parked.

# Parallelizing without collisions (the gotchas)
- **Branch overlap**: prevent two agents touching same paths by locking shards (simple Redis lock keyed by path glob).  
- **Refactor storms**: schedule repo-wide operations in maintenance windows with high-priority lock.  
- **Test flake**: agents chase ghosts; fix by snapshot baselines + deterministic seeds.  
- **Prompt drift**: maintain a **single “Agent Contract” doc** (coding standard, commit style, PR size limits, flag policy). Cascade and Claude Code can ingest curated docs to stay aligned. citeturn0search10

# “Start today” checklist (one afternoon, then iterate)
1) Add **CODEOWNERS** and path shards; wire GitHub **merge queue**.  
2) Create **Linear templates** (scope, tests, flag, telemetry).  
3) Script `jovie agent:new <ticket>` → creates worktree/branch, stubs tests, sets flag.  
4) CI required checks: `lint`, `typecheck`, `unit`, `e2e-smoke`, **build-preview**.  
5) Vercel/Neon preview branches + PostHog flag gating.  
6) Bring in **one autonomous agent (Devin)** and **one IDE agent (Cursor/Windsurf)**; run them **in parallel** on disjoint shards for a week; track PRs merged/day and rollback rate. citeturn0search0turn0search11turn0search10

# When to use “more agents” vs “one faster agent”
- **More agents** win when tasks are naturally independent (UI polish, typed-any cleanups, localized bugfixes, docs, perf micro-tweaks).  
- **One stronger/managed agent** (e.g., Devin) wins for long-horizon, cross-cutting work (Stripe integration, auth rewrites, caching layers) where global context and long sessions matter. citeturn0search0

If you want, I can drop a ready-to-paste **GitHub Actions + merge-queue + Vercel/Neon + PostHog flags** pack and a **Linear template** that enforces the agent contract.
