If by *“Apple ID fastlane”* you mean using your entity["software", "fastlane", 0] tool to authenticate with your entity["brand", "Apple", 0] ID (for e.g., App Store Connect / Developer Portal automation), here’s a concise summary for you, Mr. White:

---

### ✅ What fastlane supports  
- fastlane supports authenticating to Apple services using your Apple ID **with 2-factor authentication (2FA) or legacy 2-step verification (2SV)**. citeturn0search0turn0search8  
- It also supports authenticating via the official entity["software", "App Store Connect API", 0] (using an API key) which can avoid Apple ID login altogether. citeturn0search1turn0search0  
- You specify your Apple ID (and other details) in the `Appfile` of your fastlane setup. citeturn0search5  

---

### 🔧 Typical workflow using Apple ID  
- In your `Appfile`, you’d have something like:  
  ```ruby
  apple_id "your-apple-id@example.com"
  ``` citeturn0search5  
- If you are on a CI or automation setup:  
  - You can generate a session via `fastlane spaceauth -u your-email` to avoid interactive 2FA each time. The generated session gets stored in the environment variable `FASTLANE_SESSION`. citeturn0search0turn0search8  
  - You may also set `FASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` for some upload actions (e.g., `deliver`, `upload_to_app_store`) when using Apple ID. citeturn0search0  

---

### ⚠️ Things to watch out for  
- All Apple IDs used with App Store Connect must have 2FA/2SV enabled. Apple began enforcing this in early 2021. citeturn0search8turn0search0  
- Sessions (from `FASTLANE_SESSION`) may expire or become invalid if used in a different region/­­machinery than where they were created. citeturn0search0  
- Some fastlane actions/tools are **not yet fully supported** by the App Store Connect API key approach (so you might still need Apple ID login for those). citeturn0search1turn0search8

If you like, I can walk you through **step-by-step how to set this up** (locally or on CI) with fastlane and Apple ID, including example config and pitfalls. Would you like that?
