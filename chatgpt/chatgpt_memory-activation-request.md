turn on memory

## Assistant

Mr. White, I can’t toggle account settings here, so I’ll verify the current official ChatGPT memory controls and give you the exact setting path.

---

## Assistant

Mr. White, I can’t turn memory on from inside this chat.

To enable it:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Personalization**
3. Turn on **Reference saved memories**
4. Turn on **Reference chat history** as well, unless you only want explicit saved memories used

OpenAI’s help docs say saved memories and chat history are controlled from **Settings → Personalization**, and Temporary Chat avoids using or updating memory. citeturn703653search1turn703653search11

Yeah, it just says “memory off” in the top right of all my chats. But I have the memory settings set to automatically manage memories, so I’m confused. I don’t know if it’s maybe full or something and that’s why it’s not turning on for chats. If that’s the case, we can dump a lot of this stuff.

There’s a lot of stuff about my old girlfriend Mackenzie and about my old job at Waltz Speakeasy, including mentions of alcohol and alcohol prices. I don’t work in bars anymore, so all of that can be dumped.

## Assistant

Mr. White, I’ll verify the current memory behavior, then separate why chats show “Memory off” from how to clear outdated Mackenzie/Waltz/bar-related saved memories.

## Assistant

Mr. White, “automatic memory management” does **not** mean Memory is active in chats. It means that, when saved memories are enabled, ChatGPT can prioritize, deprioritize, and avoid hitting the “memory full” state by moving less important memories into the background. OpenAI says this feature is currently for Plus/Pro users on web and is managed from **Settings → Personalization → Manage memories**. citeturn290120view0

The fastest cleanup path:

1. Go to **Settings → Personalization → Manage memories**
2. Search/delete memories containing:
   - **Mackenzie**
   - **Waltz Speakeasy**
   - **bar**
   - **bartending**
   - **alcohol**
   - **cocktails**
   - **drink prices**
   - **bottle service**
3. Use the **⋯** menu next to each memory and select **Delete**. OpenAI also says you can delete all memories from the menu near the search bar. citeturn290120view0

Useful prompt to paste into a chat where Memory is active:

> Forget all saved memories and past-chat-derived context about Mackenzie, my old girlfriend, Waltz Speakeasy, my old bar job, alcohol, alcohol pricing, cocktails, drink menus, bottle service, and any work I did in bars. I no longer work in bars, and this context should not be used in future chats.

A few likely reasons you still see **Memory off**:

- You may be in **Temporary Chat**. Temporary chats do not use or create memories; OpenAI says the Temporary button is in the top-right of the page. citeturn290120view1
- **Reference saved memories** may be off even though another memory-related setting is on. OpenAI says turning off Reference saved memories also turns off Reference chat history. citeturn290120view0
- You may be looking at **Atlas browser memories**, which are separate from regular ChatGPT memories. Browser memories and ChatGPT memories are controlled independently. citeturn290120view2
- If you are in a work/business/enterprise workspace, an admin may control memory availability. OpenAI says Enterprise workspace owners can turn Memory on or off for all users. citeturn290120view0

Being full usually should not make every chat show “Memory off.” A full saved-memory store mainly blocks or limits new saved memories; with automatic management, ChatGPT is supposed to help avoid that by prioritizing relevant items and moving less important ones into the background. citeturn290120view0
