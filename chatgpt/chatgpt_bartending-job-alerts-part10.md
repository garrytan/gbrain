Gotcha, Mr. White — you’re talking about the **new Liquid Glass design in iOS 26**, not the old `.ultraThinMaterial` stuff.

Here’s the short version:  
On **iOS 26+, you should use the new `glassEffect` APIs + `GlassEffectContainer`** to build a floating, Liquid Glass style menu/tab bar. System tab bars get this for free, but for a custom one you wire it up yourself.

---

## 1. Easiest way: use `TabView` and let iOS 26 do it

If you just need a standard bottom tab bar, you often **don’t have to do anything**: build a normal `TabView` and run on iOS 26 — the system tab bar automatically adopts Liquid Glass. citeturn2search4turn2search5

```swift
@available(iOS 26.0, *)
struct LiquidGlassTabAppView: View {
    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            Text("Home")
                .tabItem {
                    Label("Home", systemImage: "house.fill")
                }

            Text("Search")
                .tabItem {
                    Label("Search", systemImage: "magnifyingglass")
                }

            Text("Profile")
                .tabItem {
                    Label("Me", systemImage: "person.fill")
                }
        }
        // iOS 26 will render the tab bar in Liquid Glass automatically
    }
}
```

If all you want is “menu bar at bottom with Liquid Glass look”, this is the most “Apple-blessed” route.

---

## 2. Custom **Liquid Glass menu bar** (SwiftUI, iOS 26+)

If you want a **floating pill-shaped menu bar** (like the new toolbars in Apple’s examples), use `GlassEffectContainer` + `.glassEffect(...)`. citeturn7search7turn7search9turn2search4

```swift
import SwiftUI

@available(iOS 26.0, *)
struct LiquidGlassMenuBarExample: View {
    @State private var selected = 0

    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            // Your main scrolling content
            ScrollView {
                VStack(spacing: 24) {
                    ForEach(0..<30) { i in
                        RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 16)
                            .fill(Color.blue.opacity(0.15))
                            .frame(height: 80)
                            .overlay(Text("Row \(i)"))
                            .padding(.horizontal)
                    }
                    .padding(.top, 40)
                }
            }

            // Floating Liquid Glass menu bar
            VStack {
                Spacer()

                GlassEffectContainer {
                    HStack(spacing: 32) {
                        tabItem("house.fill", tag: 0)
                        tabItem("magnifyingglass", tag: 1)
                        tabItem("heart.fill", tag: 2)
                        tabItem("person.fill", tag: 3)
                    }
                    .padding(.horizontal, 20)
                    .padding(.vertical, 10)
                    .glassEffect(
                        .regular
                            .interactive(true)                // reacts to touches
                            .tint(.blue.opacity(0.35)),       // subtle color tint
                        in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 26, style: .continuous)
                    )
                }
                .padding(.bottom, 16)
            }
            .ignoresSafeArea(.keyboard, edges: .bottom)
        }
    }

    @ViewBuilder
    private func tabItem(_ systemName: String, tag: Int) -> some View {
        let isSelected = (selected == tag)

        Button {
            selected = tag
        } label: {
            Image(systemName: systemName)
                .font(.system(size: 18, weight: .semibold))
                .symbolRenderingMode(.hierarchical)
                .foregroundStyle(isSelected ? Color.accentColor : .secondary)
                .frame(width: 32, height: 32)
        }
        .buttonStyle(.glass)   // Liquid Glass button style in iOS 26
    }
}
```

**Why this matches iOS 26 Liquid Glass:**

- `.glassEffect(...)` is the official Liquid Glass modifier for custom views. citeturn7search7turn7search5  
- `GlassEffectContainer` groups multiple glass shapes so they render as **one continuous, morphable glass surface**, just like the new tab/tool bars. citeturn7search9turn7search3  
- `.regular.interactive(true).tint(...)` gives you:
  - the standard Liquid Glass look
  - touch “squish” interactions
  - a subtle color tint instead of plain white glass. citeturn7search7turn7search4

## 3. Supporting iOS 25 and earlier (fallback)

If you need to support older OS versions, wrap the Liquid Glass bits in `#available` and fall back to `Material`:

```swift
struct MenuBarWrapper: View {
    var body: some View {
        if #available(iOS 26.0, *) {
            LiquidGlassMenuBarExample()
        } else {
            // Older look: normal blurred pill
            ZStack {
                // content …

                VStack {
                    Spacer()
                    HStack(spacing: 32) {
                        Image(systemName: "house.fill")
                        Image(systemName: "magnifyingglass")
                        Image(systemName: "heart.fill")
                        Image(systemName: "person.fill")
                    }
                    .font(.system(size: 18, weight: .semibold))
                    .foregroundStyle(.white)
                    .padding(.horizontal, 20)
                    .padding(.vertical, 10)
                    .background(.ultraThinMaterial,
                                in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 26, style: .continuous))
                    .padding(.bottom, 16)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you tell me **exactly what layout** you want (full-width like system tab bar vs floating pill vs side dock), I can rewrite this into a drop-in `LiquidGlassMenuBar` component you can just drop into your project.
