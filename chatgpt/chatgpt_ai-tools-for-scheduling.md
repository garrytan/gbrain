Talk to me real quick about the state of AI tools for like tweets and stuff in 2026. I used to use Typefully, I think it was, which was a really, like, very beautifully laid out minimal interface for writing, and I enjoyed that when I was writing. I don't need something that I can live in forever anymore. What I need now is something where I can just dump in a billion tweets and then get the fuck out of there and have it post for me. What I am doing is doing this mostly with Claude Code and stuff in Conductor and just spinning out a giant list of tweets, and then I want to import those into a tool that's just going to schedule them out and post them for me. My main goal is to be posting two or three times a day on Twitter and then also to be posting at least once or twice a day on threads and then on LinkedIn. Now I'll handle all that content and stuff through Claude Code and stuff. And whatever, and so I'm thinking about just grabbing Buffer for 12 bucks a month or something and just dumping everything into there and having it go. But what I am considering is like, I remember like TweetHunter and like Tweetful or something like that that were all really popular in like 2021 or something. And I know a lot of those tools will let you like target engagement towards people of certain, you know, hashtags and stuff like that. I'm looking at Tweetful and they literally say like, you know, generate engaging tweets in seconds and automate audience growth. Real followers, no bots, whatever, Twitter compliant. Are these, now that it's X and they've changed all the rules and stuff, are these things, and they've changed the APIs, are these still things still compliant and is there like a good tool out there that I should be using? Like what's the consensus there on this?

Mr. White,

My read in 2026 is that this market has split cleanly into two buckets: straightforward schedulers that publish through official integrations, and “growth automation” tools that promise follower/engagement acceleration. The first bucket is mature now. Buffer supports X, Threads, and LinkedIn; Typefully supports X, LinkedIn, and Threads and now has a public API for programmatic draft creation/scheduling; Threads has an official API for publishing text, image, video, and carousel posts; LinkedIn has official posting APIs and an open `w_member_social` permission for posting on behalf of an authenticated member. citeturn183667search2turn713664view4turn177231search0turn353881view2turn931509view1

For the exact workflow you described, Buffer is the boring correct answer. It supports all three networks you care about, has CSV bulk upload, lets you add posts to queue or save them as drafts, and its Bulk Upload handles up to 100 posts per channel at a time. Pricing is $5 per channel per month on annual billing, so X + Threads + LinkedIn is $15/month on that plan. The one annoyance is that bulk upload is channel-by-channel, not one giant universal import for all networks at once. citeturn340922view0turn485270view3turn931509view3turn467205view0

If you still like the old Typefully feel, the interesting 2026 reason to use it is the API, not the editor. Their v2 API lets you programmatically create, schedule, and publish drafts across X, LinkedIn, Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon, and they explicitly call out content pipelines and AI-agent workflows. For a Claude Code / Conductor setup, that is cleaner than CSV if you want your system to push drafts straight into a scheduler without living in the UI. citeturn713664view4

On TweetHunter and Tweetfull: I would treat the scheduling/writing parts as one thing and the audience-growth automation parts as a separate risk bucket. TweetHunter openly markets Auto DM, Auto Retweet, Auto Plug, and engagement automation. Tweetfull markets “automate your engagement,” keyword-based engagement automation, and auto-likes / replies / follows. X’s current Authenticity policy says users are ultimately responsible for third-party apps they authorize, and it prohibits bulk unsolicited DMs, follow churn, aggressive or automated engagement to drive traffic/attention, and the use or promotion of third-party services for those behaviors. So I would not trust a vendor’s “X compliant” badge by itself. citeturn485270view5turn895000search7turn895000search9turn552870view3turn552870view4

LinkedIn is even stricter. LinkedIn explicitly prohibits third-party software, bots, browser plug-ins, and extensions that scrape, modify the site, or automate activity on LinkedIn, and it also bans fake or manipulative engagement. Official API-based posting is supported; gray-market browser automation is the part that gets dangerous fast. citeturn485270view1turn353881view2turn931509view1

So the practical answer is: use Buffer if you want a cheap dump-and-go scheduler; use Typefully if you want a nicer programmable layer for your Claude workflow; skip TweetHunter/Tweetfull unless you are only using them for drafting/scheduling and you stay away from auto-DM, auto-engagement, follow automation, and “growth” features. That is where the compliance risk sits today. citeturn467205view0turn713664view4turn552870view3turn485270view1

I can sketch the cleanest Claude Code → CSV/API → scheduler setup for your exact posting cadence.

Okay, the typely thing with Cloud code and the API seems perfect. Can you check, because I'm on Typely right now, and it's not all of the OAuth buttons when I'm trying to sign up are just taking me to about:blank pages, which is not promising.

Mr. White,

Yes. This looks more like a browser-side OAuth failure than a “Typefully is obviously broken” failure.

Why: Typefully’s own help docs say browser issues can prevent account connections and recommend clearing Typefully site data/cache. Chrome also explicitly blocks pop-ups and redirects by default in some cases; Firefox says tracking protection can break site functionality, including login fields and forms; Safari’s cross-site tracking protection can interfere with third-party auth flows. citeturn865807view0turn653406view0turn653406view1turn653406view2

Fastest triage:
1. Clear site data for `typefully.com` and reload. Typefully specifically recommends this for connection issues. citeturn865807view0  
2. Allow pop-ups/redirects for Typefully in Chrome. Chrome documents per-site pop-up allowlisting. citeturn653406view0  
3. If you’re on Firefox, turn off Enhanced Tracking Protection for Typefully and retry. Firefox says it can break site features and specifically names login fields/forms as common breakage points. citeturn653406view1  
4. If you’re on Safari or Brave, temporarily disable cross-site tracking protection and content blockers for the site, then retry. Safari says cross-site tracking protection deletes third-party cookies/data unless you interact with that provider as a first-party site. citeturn653406view2  
5. Try a clean Chrome profile or Incognito with extensions off. That isolates blockers/cached state. Chrome’s site-permission model and Typefully’s reset guidance both point there. citeturn653406view0turn865807view0

There is also a practical workaround: Typefully supports signing up with email, and then you can connect X, LinkedIn, Threads, etc. afterward inside a Social Set. So you do not need OAuth at the initial account-creation step to prove the product works. citeturn118213view0turn926239view2

If it still throws `about:blank` after a clean-browser test, I would treat that as a real red flag and message support immediately. Typefully’s help center points to Contact Us, and their API docs also list support via email and Discord. citeturn926239view1turn777131search0

My recommendation: try email signup first, then connect accounts after. If that works, the product is still viable for your Claude Code pipeline. If even that flow is glitchy in a clean Chrome session, skip it and use Buffer.

Okay, Typefully says they have pro engagement tools. Are these tools kosher? I'm confused, because there's like a ton of big investors and stuff, some of whom I think are literally invested in Twitter, who claim to be using it.

Mr. White,

Partly. Typefully’s engagement tools are not all in the same risk category. Their help docs list four main X engagement features: auto-retweets, auto-DM campaigns, auto-plugs, and Thread Finisher. citeturn222496view0turn222496view1turn148019view0turn148019view2turn148019view3

The cleanest one is Thread Finisher. It is just a prompt block at the end of a thread that nudges people to like or repost. That is composition, not account automation. Auto-retweets are also broadly within X’s rules. X explicitly says automated reposts are allowed if they comply with the rest of the rules, while warning that bulk, aggressive, or spammy reposting violates policy. Typefully’s auto-retweet feature is exactly that category. citeturn148019view1turn150240view1

Auto-plugs are more conditional. Typefully describes them as an automatic follow-up reply that fires once a post hits an engagement threshold. X does allow creative auto-reply campaigns when users engage with your content, and gives opt-in examples like users taking a specific action on a post to receive an automated response. That said, X also says automated activity should match user expectations and not surprise people. So an auto-plug is probably fine when the follow-up is clearly relevant and non-spammy; it gets riskier when it feels like bait, promo stuffing, or irrelevant link dumping. citeturn148019view2turn150240view2turn222496view2

Auto-DMs are the shakiest feature. Typefully says it can automatically DM users who retweet, reply, or follow, and it recommends disclosing that in the first post. X’s current rules are narrower. X says you may not send unsolicited automated DMs in bulk, and you may only send automated DMs when recipients have already requested or clearly indicated they want to be contacted by DM, plus you must provide opt-out. X also says that simply following you or having DMs open does not by itself count as consent. Typefully’s own article says “follow” can trigger an auto-DM, which does not line up cleanly with X’s rule. That is the part I would treat as policy-risky. citeturn148019view0turn150240view3

There is another bright red line: X says AI-powered automated reply bots require prior written and explicit approval from X. So if a tool is doing dynamic AI replies at scale, that is a different and riskier category than scheduled posting or fixed follow-up messages. citeturn150240view0

My practical conclusion: Typefully itself is a legitimate tool. Its scheduler/editor/API stack looks fine. Some of its “engagement” features also fit inside X’s written rules. The full bundle is not automatically “kosher” just because prominent people use it. Big users often use the safe parts only, and enforcement is applied to account behavior, not to a blanket “approved vendor” list. X also says you are responsible for whatever a third-party app does through your account. citeturn222496view2turn222496view3

My recommendation is simple. Use Typefully for drafting, scheduling, analytics, and maybe conservative auto-retweets. Treat auto-DMs and any automated reply/growth mechanics as opt-in-only and high caution. I would personally avoid any workflow that auto-DMs on follow, or that automates “growth” in a way that looks like engagement bait. citeturn148019view0turn150240view3

If you want, I’ll give you a clean green/yellow/red list of Typefully features for your exact use case.
