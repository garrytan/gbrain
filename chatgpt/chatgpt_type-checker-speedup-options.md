Yeah, we use Biome for speed. Is there a type checker we can switch to that would get us faster results? We're currently at 80 seconds on normal PR.

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — yes: the main “switch type checker for speed” option right now is **TypeScript’s native compiler preview (`tsgo`)** (the Go port / “TypeScript 7” preview). Microsoft is publishing it on npm as **`@typescript/native-preview`**, and you run it like `tsc`. citeturn1view0turn1view1

### What to switch to
- **`tsgo` (via `@typescript/native-preview`)**: meant to be a drop-in for type-checking, and Microsoft has shown **~10× speedups** on a large real-world repo (example: ~73s → ~6.8s in their blog). citeturn1view0  
- **Don’t bother with `stc`** as an alternative today; that repo is archived/read-only. citeturn0search2turn0search14  
- **Biome v2 “Biotype”** adds *type-aware lint rules*, but it’s not a replacement for full TS typechecking. citeturn0search3turn0search7

### How to try it in CI (minimal disruption)
1. Install:
   - `npm i -D @typescript/native-preview` citeturn1view0
2. Replace your PR typecheck command:
   - from: `tsc -p . --noEmit`
   - to: `npx tsgo -p . --noEmit` citeturn1view1

### Caveats you should expect (so it doesn’t surprise you)
- It’s still a **preview**; feature parity and edge cases are in flux, so you should trial it on PR checks first and keep `tsc` available as a fallback. citeturn1view1turn1view0
- Some workflows/features have historically lagged in previews (and may differ by preview version), so confirm anything you rely on like build mode / project references / declaration emit in *your* pipeline before cutting over fully. citeturn1view0turn1view1

### If you *don’t* want to switch compilers, fastest “no-drama” wins
Even with `tsc`, big PR-time reductions usually come from:
- **Project references + `tsc -b`**, and caching `*.tsbuildinfo`
- **`--incremental`**, **`skipLibCheck`**, and making sure CI caches `node_modules` + TS cache files

If you tell me what your current typecheck command is (and whether you use project references), I can suggest the smallest change most likely to cut that **~80s** down.

---

## User

Um, yeah, but what's like the industry standard? Like, what is Anthropic using and shit? Like, what, like, what are you even talking about?

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — **industry standard today is still `tsc` (the TypeScript compiler) for type-checking**. ESLint/Biome are *linters*; they don’t replace full type-checking. citeturn0search15

On **“what is Anthropic using?”**: in their public TypeScript repos, they’re running **`yarn tsc`** in build scripts and pinning **TypeScript 5.8.3**, plus **ESLint + `@typescript-eslint`** for linting. citeturn2view0turn2view2

So what I was talking about:
- If you want **industry-standard / lowest-risk**: stick with **`tsc --noEmit`** (and speed it up with incremental/build mode + caching).
- If you want **fastest type-checking** and can tolerate “preview” risk: try **Microsoft’s Go-based TypeScript native preview (`tsgo`)**, which is explicitly aimed at big speedups. citeturn0search15

If your PR check is 80s, you usually get the biggest win without changing the checker by making sure you’re using:
- project references (`tsc -b`)
- `incremental` + caching `*.tsbuildinfo` in CI
- `skipLibCheck` (Anthropic uses it in that tokenizer repo) citeturn2view1

Tell me your current PR command (and whether you’re monorepo / project refs), and I’ll give the smallest set of changes most likely to cut that 80s.

## User

Are you able to tell me exactly what their CI runs are?

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — for **Anthropic’s public TypeScript SDK repo** (`anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript`), their GitHub Actions **CI workflow** is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and it runs **three jobs**: `lint`, `build`, and `test`. citeturn3view0

### CI workflow triggers (when it runs)
- Runs on **push** (with some branch patterns ignored) and **pull_request** (with some branch patterns ignored). citeturn3view0

### Job 1: `lint`
Runs on Ubuntu (or a specific runner when in another repo name condition) and does:
1. `actions/checkout@v6`
2. `actions/setup-node@v4` with **Node 20**
3. `./scripts/bootstrap`
4. `./bin/replace-internal-symlinks`
5. `./scripts/build-all`
6. `./scripts/lint` (this is where their “check types” is invoked) citeturn3view0

### Job 2: `build`
Does:
1. checkout
2. setup-node Node 20
3. bootstrap
4. replace-internal-symlinks
5. build-all
6. **conditionally** (only if repo name matches a specific value) gets a GitHub **OIDC token** and runs `./scripts/utils/upload-artifact.sh` to upload a tarball citeturn3view0

### Job 3: `test`
Does:
1. checkout
2. setup-node Node 20
3. bootstrap
4. replace-internal-symlinks
5. build-all
6. `./scripts/test` citeturn3view0

---

They also have a separate workflow called **“Claude Code”** (`.github/workflows/claude.yml`) that triggers on issue/PR comment/review events containing `@claude`, and runs `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`. citeturn3view1

If you tell me which Anthropic repo you mean beyond `anthropic-sdk-typescript` (they have several), I can pull the exact workflow commands for that one too.

---

## User

Explain to me what they're doing with internal sem links, what that even does, and then tell me what that workflow is that you mentioned at the end.

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — here’s what’s going on with **`replace-internal-symlinks`** and the other workflow I mentioned:

---

## 🔁 What “internal symlinks” likely refers to

The **CI in the Anthropic TypeScript SDK** includes a step named:

```
Update internal symlinks in third party packages
run: ./bin/replace-internal-symlinks
```  
This runs before build/lint/tests. citeturn0search0

### What this *actually* does
It’s not documented explicitly in their repo, but the intent is clear:

- In monorepos or shared code setups, teams sometimes use **symbolic links (symlinks) to point code in one place to another** instead of duplicating it.
- A script like **`replace-internal-symlinks`** will **scan your package tree and replace certain symlink paths with real file references** that CI tools (especially Windows runners) and package tools can resolve reliably before building/testing.

Why do this? Because:
- GitHub Actions runners + package managers often handle symlinks inconsistently across OSes.
- Tools like TypeScript, Jest, ESLint may not traverse symlinks reliably, causing false errors.
- Replacing symlinks with real code on CI ensures consistent, reproducible builds/tests.

In other words, the script is ensuring that any **local shared dependencies or internal links are materialized** before the rest of the pipeline runs.

This is *a pattern you see in large SDKs/monorepos to normalize workspace layouts* for CI.

---

## 📦 What the “other workflow” is

I mentioned another workflow by name — that’s the **Claude Code GitHub Actions integration workflow** they include in some repos under `.github/workflows/claude.yml`. That’s a **separate CI action** specifically meant to run Claude Code automation on comments in PRs/issues. citeturn0search13

### What it does
The **`claude.yml` workflow**:

- Triggers on events like issue comments or PR comments containing a trigger like `@claude`.
- Runs the **Anthropic-provided GitHub Action** (`anthropics/claude-code-action`) which:
  - Executes Claude Code against your repo to generate changes or responses based on the specified prompt.
  - Can automate PR edits, code fixes, or other scripted interactions directly from natural-language comments. citeturn0search13

This workflow is *not part of the normal CI build/lint/test suite* — it’s specifically for integrating AI automation (Claude Code) into workflows, so you can trigger AI-driven tasks from PR or issue comments.

---

## 🧠 Why both matter

- **`replace-internal-symlinks`** fixes local repo layout issues for tooling before you type-check/build.
- The **`claude.yml` workflow** is for AI automation via Claude Code triggered by PR/issue events.

They are **completely different concerns**: one is about making your build/test pipeline reliable; the other is about enabling AI-powered automation in your GitHub workflow.

---

If you want, I can pull the exact source of `replace-internal-symlinks` (if available) so you can see exactly what it does step-by-step.

---

## User

Is the exact workflow public?

---

## Assistant

Yes — **the exact CI workflow Anthropic uses in the public `anthropic-sdk-typescript` repo is entirely public** on GitHub. You can view the full YAML definition straight from the source here:

- **CI workflow file on GitHub (raw view)**: link_titleView `ci.yml` on raw.githubusercontent.comturn0view0

That file shows exactly what runs in CI: lint, build, and test jobs, including the *internal symlink replacement* step. citeturn0view0

It’s a **standard public GitHub Actions workflow** committed as part of the repository, so anything in that file is open and readable. citeturn0view0

The other workflow I mentioned — **“Claude Code” (`claude.yml`)** — is also public and visible under the repo’s `.github/workflows/` directory; you can click “Claude Code” in the Actions UI to see it or open the file directly in the GitHub repo. citeturn0search8

In short:  
✔️ The CI workflow is public and version-controlled right alongside the SDK code. citeturn0view0  
✔️ Anthropic uses separate workflows for CI, Claude Code triggers, CodeQL, releases, etc. — all visible in the public repo’s workflow directory. citeturn0search2

If you want a breakdown of what *each job* does step-by-step, I can parse that YAML into a simple summary for you.

## User

You can continue to tell me exactly what our coverage is. I'll break it out on the table.
