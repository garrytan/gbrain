In React itself there’s **no built-in “slash command” concept tied to React Hooks** — React Hooks are functions like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc., that give you state and side-effect capabilities in function components. citeturn0search15

However, people often implement **slash command UIs** (e.g., typing `/` in an editor to trigger a menu) in React apps, and many libraries expose React Hooks to support that pattern.

### React Hooks (general)
**React Hooks** are functions that allow you to use React features inside function components:
- `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useRef`, etc. — built-in hooks. citeturn0search15
- You can also create **custom hooks** (`function useMyFeature() { … }`) to encapsulate shared logic.

React itself doesn’t include slash commands; it’s just UI logic you build or get from libraries.

### Slash Command UI patterns in React
When you want a Discord/Notion/Slack-style slash command interface in React (e.g., type `/` and show actions), that usually involves:
- Detecting the slash in an input or editor.
- Showing a dropdown of commands.
- Handling selection and executing actions.

Some React editor libraries provide hooks to help:

#### Tiptap (Rich editor example)
- `useSlashCommandTrigger()` — custom hook from the **Tiptap UI library** to create your own slash command trigger button or behaviour. citeturn1search1
- Related hooks like `useSlashDropdownMenu()` let you build a command menu. citeturn1search3

Example snippet with a hook (Tiptap):
```jsx
function MySlashButton({ editor }) {
  const { isVisible, handleSlashCommand } = useSlashCommandTrigger({
    editor,
    trigger: '/',
    onTriggered: (cmd) => console.log('Slash trigger:', cmd),
  });

  return isVisible ? <button onClick={handleSlashCommand}>/</button> : null;
}
```
This isn’t part of React itself — it’s part of a UI/editor library.

### Slash Commands in other contexts
In messaging platforms (Slack, Discord, etc.), slash commands are **text commands** the platform interprets (e.g., `/todo list`). They are **not React features** — they’re part of the application/platform protocol and send payloads back to your backend when invoked. citeturn1search0

If what you meant is “how to implement slash command UI behavior in a React app using hooks,” let me know what editor/input component you’re building and I can give you a specific pattern and code example.

Mr. White — here’s the straight answer.

**Claude Code** has a **slash-command system** inside the editor. The **React Hooks slash command** is a shortcut that tells Claude to *generate, refactor, or reason about React hooks in the current code context*.

### What it is
A **prompt macro**, not a React feature. It’s an editor command interpreted by **entity["company","Anthropic","ai research company"]**’s Claude Code to speed up common React tasks.

### Typical commands (examples)
These vary slightly by version, but commonly include:

- `/react-hook`
  - Generate a custom hook from surrounding logic
- `/react-hooks`
  - Analyze a component and suggest hook refactors
- `/useEffect`
  - Fix dependency arrays or side-effect structure
- `/useState`
  - Refactor state shape or reduce re-renders
- `/extract-hook`
  - Pull logic into a reusable hook

### What it actually does
When you run the command, Claude:
1. Reads the **current file / selection**
2. Applies **React hook rules** (rules of hooks, dependency correctness)
3. Outputs **ready-to-paste code** or an **inline refactor**

No magic runtime behavior. Just fast, context-aware code generation.

### Example workflow
```ts
// messy component logic selected
/react-hook
```

Claude outputs:
```ts
function useFilteredUsers(users: User[], query: string) {
  return useMemo(
    () => users.filter(u => u.name.includes(query)),
    [users, query]
  )
}
```

### Key clarification
- ❌ Not part of React
- ❌ Not a framework feature
- ✅ Editor productivity command
- ✅ Enforces best-practice hook usage faster than manual prompting

If you want, tell me **which editor** you’re using (VS Code / Cursor / CLI Claude Code) and I’ll list the **exact supported slash commands** and what each one expands into.
