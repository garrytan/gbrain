We have more and more AI agents running, and they're using things like G-Stack and QA and all these different tools and stuff. We have more orchestration and iteration processing. I'm leaning on hardening CI/CD instead of being very limited by quick merge PRs and a stronger set on main. I'm leaning on PR being more thorough so that main just stays solid longer. Can you give me pros and cons and also look at our actual CI files and decide what would be optimal? 

basically i want a rock solid app but i dont want to slow down. but since i can have an hourly cron just drain the prs with auto remediation it might make sence to shcane our paln but im not sure.

I’m going to inspect the repo’s CI configuration, weigh stronger PR gates against post-merge repair, and then recommend a merge model that keeps throughput high while keeping `main` solid.

I found the public Jovie repo and workflow set, and the current pipeline looks lighter than expected. I’m checking the actual YAML and GitHub rules to pin down whether the real gap is missing PR validation or just a few weak gates.

The main issue looks like policy drift: your checked-in governance, actual required checks, and deploy gate do not line up, and humans can merge with a lighter gate than the agent path. I’m narrowing this toward tightening the enforced PR gate on `preview` rather than making `main` heavier, with merge queue favored over an hourly drain.

Mr. White,

I don’t have the raw repo checkout in this session, so the repo-specific part here is based on the Jovie workflow details you already shared: feature branches merge into `preview`, `preview` promotes into `main`, and the current key checks are `CI / pr-policy`, `CI / up-to-date-with-preview`, and `CI / ci-fast`.

My recommendation: make `preview` the hard integration gate, keep `main` as a narrow promotion gate, put a merge queue on `preview`, and use cron for remediation only.

GitHub’s merge queue is built for busy branches and validates queued PRs against the latest base plus queued changes ahead of them. It gives you the same freshness benefit as forcing branches to stay up to date, without making authors constantly rebase. Every required workflow must also trigger on `merge_group`, or queued PRs will fail to report the required checks. citeturn541723view0turn541723view1turn199837view2

The hourly cron idea fits upkeep. It fits rebases, flaky reruns, trivial autofixes, and setting green PRs to merge when ready. It is weak as the primary merge controller. Scheduled Actions can be delayed or dropped under heavy load, especially at the start of the hour, and they only run from the default branch. Schedule it off the hour, such as `:17` or `:23`, and keep it out of the authoritative merge path. citeturn199837view0

Here is the tradeoff clearly:

- **Heavier PR gate on `preview`**: best stability with many agent PRs, faster failure isolation, greener shared branches. Cost: more CI minutes and tighter pressure to keep the fast suite actually fast.
- **Heavier `main` gate**: simpler day to day, faster initial merges. Cost: integration failures land later, `preview` becomes less trustworthy, and production promotion gets noisier.
- **Cron drain**: good hygiene and less manual babysitting. Cost: weaker freshness guarantees and worse failure attribution.

For your setup, the best version is the first one.

### What I would change in your workflows

**1) `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**

Add `merge_group`. Keep the required job names stable. Required checks are matched by check name, not by workflow file or trigger type, so stable job names matter when you add queue-based validation. citeturn439608search20

Remove any workflow-level `paths-ignore` from required workflows. When a required workflow is skipped by path or branch filters, GitHub leaves the check pending and blocks the merge. When a job is skipped inside a running workflow, it reports success. That is the clean fix for your docs-only PR problem. Keep the workflow alive, use a small “changes” step, and early-exit irrelevant jobs. citeturn199837view2turn199837view1

Core shape:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [preview, main]
  merge_group:
  push:
    branches: [preview, main]

concurrency:
  group: ci-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

GitHub Actions runs concurrently by default, so keeping `concurrency` is the right way to cancel superseded PR runs and serialize branch-specific work. citeturn541723view2

**2) `CI / up-to-date-with-preview`**

Once merge queue is enabled on `preview`, I would remove this as a **required** check. The queue already validates PRs against the latest `preview` state and earlier queued changes. Keep it as an informational signal if you like the visibility. citeturn541723view0turn541723view1

**3) `auto-merge-preview.yml`**

Keep the automation, but aim it at **queue when ready** semantics on `preview`. Low-risk PRs should auto-queue after `pr-policy` and `ci-fast` pass. Sensitive-path PRs should require human signoff.

Put these paths under CODEOWNERS:
- `.github/workflows/**`
- migrations / schema
- auth
- billing
- infra / deployment scripts

GitHub protected branches can require code-owner review, and CODEOWNERS can specifically protect workflow files. citeturn303865search3turn303865search6turn303865search9

**4) `branch-protection-apply.yml`**

For `preview`:
- require PRs
- require merge queue
- require `CI / pr-policy`
- require `CI / ci-fast`
- disable direct pushes
- start queue settings around build concurrency **2–4** and merge limits **1–2**
- leave **Only merge non-failing pull requests** enabled

GitHub exposes build concurrency, merge limits, and the non-failing-only option on merge queue settings. citeturn541723view1

For `main`:
- require PRs
- require **1 human approval**
- keep production deployment behind the `production` environment reviewer gate
- restrict production deployment to `main`

Protected environments can require reviewers, restrict which branches can deploy, and withhold environment secrets until approval. citeturn541723view4

**5) Security and stability**

Keep `permissions` minimal. Long term, move branch-protection automation away from a broad PAT if possible and toward a GitHub App token. Pin third-party actions to full commit SHAs. GitHub recommends least-privilege workflow tokens and SHA pinning for immutable third-party actions. citeturn541723view3turn199837view3

**6) Cleanup debt**

Earlier notes on this repo mentioned stale `develop` / `dev` references in things like CodeQL, Lighthouse, and Dependabot. Clean those now. They either waste runs or leave blind spots.

### What should be required vs. moved out of the critical path

**Required on PR / merge queue into `preview`**
- lint
- typecheck
- unit tests
- build
- migration sanity check
- a focused smoke test

**Run after merge to `preview`**
- preview deploy
- smoke against the preview URL
- targeted browser/integration checks
- ephemeral DB migration validation when schema changes

**Run nightly or non-blocking**
- full E2E matrix
- Lighthouse
- CodeQL
- long-running agent journeys
- soak / synthetic flows

Any workflow you make required under merge queue also needs `merge_group`, including code scanning if you require it. citeturn445483search17turn199837view2

### Net recommendation

For Jovie, the optimal operating model is:

1. Agent PR opens to `preview`.
2. `CI / pr-policy` classifies risk.
3. `CI / ci-fast` runs.
4. Low-risk PRs auto-queue.
5. Merge queue validates the fresh combined state and merges to `preview`.
6. `preview` deploys and runs smoke checks.
7. Promotion PR to `main` is created or updated.
8. One human approval plus `production` environment approval gates deploy.

That keeps the app solid and preserves speed because the friction is tiered by branch and risk.

Send the current `.github/workflows/*.yml` files and I’ll mark the exact edits line by line.
