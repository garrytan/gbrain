“Fast mode” in **Claude** refers to a **high-speed configuration of the Claude Opus 4.6 model** that prioritizes much faster output generation without changing the model’s intelligence or capabilities.citeturn0search0turn0search14

**Key points:**  
- It’s **not a different model** — it runs the *same* Opus 4.6 weights, just in a configuration tuned for speed.citeturn0search14  
- The main benefit is **up to about 2.5× faster output token generation**, which means you get responses much quicker.citeturn0search0turn0search14  
- It’s currently a **research-preview feature** available via Claude Code or the API (e.g., through `/fast` in Claude Code or `speed:"fast"` in API calls).citeturn0search14  
- The trade-off is **higher cost**: fast mode runs at a premium price per token (several times the standard Opus 4.6 pricing).citeturn0search8turn0search14

In practice, it’s designed for **latency-sensitive, interactive workflows** like live coding, debugging, or tight feedback loops where response speed matters more than cost.citeturn0search15
