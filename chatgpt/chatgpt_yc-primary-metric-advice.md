yc on what metric to track

---

## Assistant

I’m checking YC’s own essays, videos, and guidance to pin down the exact recommendation and the context where they make it.

---

## Assistant

YC’s clearest rule so far is: pick one primary metric, and for most startups that metric should be revenue, ideally recurring revenue. I’m pulling the exceptions and the growth-rate guidance next.

Mr. White,

YC’s guidance is to track **one primary metric** that best captures the value your company delivers. For most startups, YC says that metric should be **revenue**, and for SaaS specifically **MRR** is usually the best choice. They describe revenue as the strongest signal because customers are proving value by paying. citeturn771827view0turn771827view2

YC’s main exception is when **audience size has to come before monetization**. In that case, use **active users** instead of revenue. That applies most often to ad-driven consumer products and some strong network-effect businesses. YC explicitly treats **DAU or WAU** as a weaker but still useful proxy for value when monetization comes later. citeturn771827view0turn771827view2

For **marketplaces**, YC recommends a metric that reflects value on both sides, such as **nights booked** or **weekly trips**, rather than just “users.” They also warn against vanity metrics like **email signups**, and they generally dislike **MAU** for early startups because it updates too slowly to be a good operating metric. citeturn771827view0turn771827view2

Once you pick the metric, YC says the job is to **grow that primary metric every week**. Their startup-school guidance says strong early companies often grow around **5% to 10% week over week**, with roughly **1% weekly growth** being a sign you likely have not found true startup-scale momentum yet. citeturn771827view1turn623117search1

Practical YC-style rule:
- **B2B / SaaS:** MRR
- **Consumer app before monetization:** DAU or WAU
- **Marketplace:** completed transactions like bookings, trips, or GMV-derived take rate
- **Hard tech / biotech pre-launch:** paid pilots, contracts, or key technical milestones if regulation blocks sales citeturn771827view0

If Jovie is already charging, the YC answer is probably **weekly MRR growth**. If you want, I can map this to Jovie specifically and tell you the exact primary metric plus 3 supporting metrics to track.

what about for a link in bio where you set ip up and stop using it but you add it to you profiles and send traffic

---

## Assistant

I’m checking YC’s actual guidance against this passive-use pattern, because “active users” gets distorted when the product keeps working after setup.

---

## Assistant

Mr. White,

For a **link-in-bio** product, I would **not** use creator logins as the primary metric. YC says the primary metric should measure **value delivered**, reflect **recurring or enduring value**, and be a **lagging indicator** rather than a vanity metric like signups. YC also says revenue is best when available, and active users only work when “active” is defined around real value, not superficial activity. citeturn757239view2turn852336view2

For your case, the best YC-style primary metric is usually:

**Weekly active link pages**  
Defined as: pages that received meaningful traffic and produced at least one outbound click in the last 7 days.

That fits the product better because the user may set it up once and stop logging in, while the product is still creating value every day by routing profile traffic. This is an inference from YC’s rule: measure the thing that proves the product is working, not whether the creator opened the dashboard. YC explicitly warns that the metric should capture real delivered value and that weak definitions of “active” are misleading. citeturn757239view2turn852336view2

A good hierarchy is:

- **If monetized by subscription:** **MRR** is the primary metric. YC’s default for subscription businesses is recurring revenue. citeturn757239view2turn852336view0
- **If free, pre-monetization:** **Weekly active link pages** is the best primary metric.
- **If monetized on traffic or transactions:** use the monetization output, such as **net revenue** or take-rate revenue, not gross traffic. YC distinguishes sharply between volume flowing through the product and the money that actually reaches you. citeturn852336view1

For this specific product, I would define the primary metric as one of these:

1. **Weekly active pages** = pages with at least X unique visitors and Y outbound clicks  
2. **Weekly outbound clicks** from active pages  
3. **MRR** once paid plans matter

My preference:
- **Pre-revenue:** weekly active pages
- **Post-revenue:** MRR

Supporting metrics:
- outbound clicks per active page
- visitor-to-click conversion rate
- 4-week page retention
- share of new pages still getting traffic after 30 days

The main thing to avoid is:
- signups
- total pages created
- dashboard DAU/WAU for creators

Those miss the actual value loop. YC specifically says signups are a trap and that a metric should be close to delivered value. citeturn757239view2

For investors, the sentence version is:

**“Our core metric is weekly active link pages: pages that receive traffic and send users outbound. That measures enduring value better than creator logins, because this is a passive utility product.”**

I can turn this into a one-line YC application answer for Jovie.
