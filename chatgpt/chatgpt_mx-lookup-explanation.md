Mr. White — “MX lookup” refers to querying the DNS for the **Mail Exchange (MX) records** of a domain. citeturn0search12turn0search3turn0search15  

### What it is  
- An MX record indicates the mail server(s) that receive incoming email for a domain. citeturn0search5  
- Each MX record has a priority value (lower number = higher priority) and a hostname of the mail server. citeturn0search6turn0search3  
- When someone sends email to `user@domain.com`, the sending server looks up MX records for `domain.com` to know where to deliver the message. citeturn0search10  

### Why you use it  
- To verify that your domain’s email receiving setup is correct (you have valid MX records pointing to the correct mail server). citeturn0search2turn0search15  
- To troubleshoot email delivery failures: missing or misconfigured MX records often cause emails to bounce or never arrive. citeturn0search15turn0search2  
- To ensure redundancy: having multiple MX records means if the highest-priority mail server fails, others can take over. citeturn0search17  

### How to perform an MX lookup  
- **Online tools**: Enter the domain to look up and the tool will list MX records with priorities and mail server hostnames. Example tools: entity["software", "MXToolbox", 0], entity["software", "DNSChecker", 0]. citeturn0search0turn0search2  
- **Command-line**:  
  - On Windows: `nslookup -type=mx domain.com` citeturn0search8turn0search7  
  - On macOS/Linux: `dig domain.com mx` or `host -t mx domain.com` citeturn0search8  

If you like, I can show you the MX records for a specific domain — would you like me to do that?
