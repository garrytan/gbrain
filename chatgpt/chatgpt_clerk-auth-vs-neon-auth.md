clerk auth vs neon auth

## Assistant

Here’s a clear, technical comparison of **Clerk Auth** vs **Neon Auth** — what they are, how they differ, and when you’d pick one versus the other.

---

## What They Are

### **Clerk Auth**
- A **hosted authentication provider** that handles user identity — signup, login, sessions, social logins, multi-factor, etc.
- You integrate it into your app (e.g., Next.js) and it manages users/accounts for you.
- Comes with SDKs, UI components, session handling, token issuance, and advanced flows like organizations or roles. citeturn0search9

**Key Characteristics**
- Full **authentication service** with user management.
- Hosted by Clerk; you don’t run the auth infrastructure.
- Integrates into apps with minimal backend code.
- Good balance of functionality and simplicity.

---

### **Neon Auth**
- A **managed authentication layer built into the Neon ecosystem** (a serverless Postgres platform). citeturn0search8
- It provisions an auth provider (currently backed by **Stack Auth**) and **auto-syncs user data directly into your Neon Postgres database**.
- Rather than just issuing tokens, Neon Auth keeps an up-to-date users table inside Postgres that you can query with SQL.

**Key Characteristics**
- Tightly **integrated with Neon Postgres**.
- Eliminates custom sync code between auth provider and database.
- Puts user profiles directly in your database as first-class tables.
- Simplifies relational use cases (e.g., joins with app data).

## Core Differences

| Feature | Clerk Auth | Neon Auth |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Primary Role** | Hosted authentication provider | Managed auth + automatic database sync |
| **User Management** | Yes — sign-up, login, sessions, MFA, social, roles | Yes — via integrated provider (Stack Auth) |
| **Database Sync** | Not automatic — you must sync if needed | Built-in, continuous sync to Postgres tables | citeturn0search2turn0search8
| **Integration Scope** | App-centric auth flows + UI components | Database-centric auth with sync |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | Auth hosted with Clerk | Auth data lives in your database (can reduce lock-in) | citeturn0search8
| **Configuration Effort** | SDK + dashboard + app setup | Neon console + database tables |
| **Use Case Fit** | Best for apps needing rich auth flows and UI | Best when auth data must be queryable and relational |

## When to Use Each

### **Use Clerk Auth if…**
- You want a **full featured authentication service** with minimal backend work.
- You need **pre-built UI components**, passwordless options, social logins, sessions, roles, multi-factor, etc.
- You don’t want to write or maintain authentication infrastructure.

**Example:** SaaS app with complex login/registration flows and roles.

---

### **Use Neon Auth if…**
- Your stack is built **around Neon Postgres** and you want **auth data automatically synced into SQL**.
- You want to **avoid writing sync code (webhooks/polling)** to keep your app’s user table up to date. citeturn0search2
- You prefer querying user data directly with SQL (joins, RLS policies, etc.).

**Example:** Backend where user relationships and access control logic are primarily done via database queries.

---

## How They Work Together

- You *can* use **Clerk as the auth provider while storing user data in Neon Postgres**, but without Neon Auth you’d normally write sync code (webhooks or login-time sync) to populate your database. citeturn0search2
- **Neon Auth** aims to remove that manual layer by managing sync for you and keeping auth data in the database.

---

## Summary

- **Clerk Auth** = standalone, full auth service focused on handling user login/identity in your app.
- **Neon Auth** = auth service built around your database with automatic sync of user profiles into SQL tables.

Your choice depends on architectural priorities: **developer speed & rich auth features (Clerk)** vs **database-centric identity management (Neon Auth)**.
