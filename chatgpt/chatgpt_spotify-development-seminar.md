## User

So Spotify put out a seminar, there was a talk or something about their development process and how they're shipping tens of thousands of PRs a day. I want you to find that video. It came out in the last week, I think. I want you to find that video, and then I want you to read the transcript, and then I want you to lay out exactly what it is that they're doing.

## Assistant

I’ll look for the recent Spotify engineering talk, verify the exact video, then extract whatever transcript or notes are available and summarize the process mechanics.

## Assistant

Mr. White, I found the likely video/talk cluster.

## The video

The closest match is **“Let’s Talk Agentic Development: Spotify x Anthropic Live”** on YouTube, featuring Spotify Chief Architect **Niklas Gustavsson** with Anthropic’s **David Soria Parra** and **Christian Ryan**. Spotify’s own engineering post describes it as a fireside chat about agentic-first development at scale, Honk, Backstage, MCP, context, testing, reviews, and governance. citeturn549622view2

There is also a newer **Spotify Investor Day 2026** segment titled **“Intelligence: AI, Honk, and the Spotify Machine”**, released May 21, 2026, where Gustav Söderström and Niklas Gustavsson discuss Honk and Spotify’s AI development process. Spotify’s recap says **99% of Spotify engineers use AI weekly**, **73%+ of code contributions are AI-assisted**, and the company ships **4,500+ production changes per day**. citeturn431314search0turn431314search1

Important correction: I did **not** find Spotify claiming “tens of thousands of PRs per day.” The public claim appears to be **4,500 production changes per day**, plus **tens of thousands of software components/services**, and **1,500+ merged AI-generated PRs** from Honk. citeturn431314search0turn770141view0turn770290view4

## What Spotify is actually doing

### 1. They standardized the engineering surface first

Spotify’s AI success is built on years of internal developer-platform work, mainly:

| Layer | Role |
|---|---|
| **Backstage** | Catalog of services, ownership, dependencies, metadata, deployment state, lineage |
| **Golden technologies** | Standardized blessed stacks/patterns across teams |
| **Fleet Management** | System for running code changes across many repos/components |
| **Honk** | Agentic layer that turns natural language/code-migration intent into PRs |

In the Anthropic talk, Spotify says they made a “fairly high degree of standardization” bet years before AI, then layered **Fleet Management** on top to automate changes across their software fleet. They describe having **tens of thousands of components** that make up production software. citeturn770141view0

### 2. Fleet Management was already opening PRs automatically

Before Honk, Spotify had deterministic automation: write a migration script, run it across repos in containers, and automatically open PRs.

Spotify’s engineering blog says Fleet Management runs source-to-source transformations as jobs in a containerized environment, then automatically opens PRs against target repositories. Since mid-2024, around **half of Spotify’s PRs** have come from this automated system. citeturn770290view4

Examples:

- Dependency bumps
- Deployment manifest updates
- Simple refactors
- Deprecated method replacement
- Config migrations

The problem: deterministic scripts hit a complexity ceiling. Spotify gives an example of a Maven dependency updater growing to **20,000+ lines of code** because edge cases pile up. citeturn770290view4

### 3. Honk replaces brittle code-mod scripts with coding agents

Honk started as a way to break through that code-mod ceiling.

Instead of writing deterministic transformation scripts, an engineer writes a prompt. Honk then uses an agent to edit code, run verification, and produce PRs. Spotify says the surrounding infrastructure remains the same: targeting repos, opening PRs, reviews, merging, and production workflows. citeturn770290view4

Spotify built a small internal CLI around the agent. That CLI can:

- Delegate prompts to agents
- Run formatting/linting/build/test tools
- Use MCP for local verification
- Evaluate diffs using an LLM judge
- Upload logs to GCP
- Capture traces in MLflow
- Swap between agent/model providers as needed citeturn770290view4

They currently say **Claude Code** is their best-performing agent and has powered most of their background-agent PRs. citeturn202967view0

### 4. The user interaction is Slack-native

In the talk, Spotify describes a common interaction: people discuss a problem in Slack, then mention Honk and tell it to solve the issue. Honk kicks off work in the background. citeturn770141view0

The newer Backstage webinar page describes the same pattern: an engineer can ask Claude from Slack on a phone to fix a bug or add a feature to the iOS app; when finished, the engineer gets a new app version pushed back through Slack and can merge to production. citeturn770290view0

### 5. They keep the agent constrained

Spotify’s lesson: agents are more reliable when surrounded by strong infrastructure and narrow permissions.

They deliberately keep Honk focused:

- It sees the relevant codebase.
- It edits files.
- It uses a limited Git tool.
- It can run verifiers.
- It has a strict Bash allowlist.
- It runs inside a sandboxed container.
- It does not get broad production/system access. citeturn202967view0turn202967view1

They avoid exposing too many tools directly to the agent because every tool increases unpredictability. Instead, they try to put key context in prompts or generate prompts through separate workflow agents. citeturn202967view0

### 6. They use verification loops as the core reliability mechanism

This is the biggest practical takeaway.

Honk does not just generate code and throw it over the wall. It runs a loop:

1. Agent edits code.
2. Agent calls a `verify` tool.
3. Verifiers run formatters, linters, builds, and tests.
4. Failures are summarized into agent-readable feedback.
5. Agent retries.
6. If verification fails, no PR is opened.
7. If verification passes, PR can be opened. citeturn202967view1

Spotify’s verifiers are abstracted. For example, a Maven verifier auto-activates when it sees a `pom.xml`; the agent does not need to understand Maven commands or parse noisy test output. citeturn202967view1

They also run an **LLM-as-judge** step that compares the proposed diff against the original prompt. Spotify says this judge vetoes about **25%** of agent sessions, and the agent can course-correct about half the time after a veto. citeturn202967view1

### 7. Prompting is treated like versioned infrastructure

Spotify’s prompt lessons:

- Describe the desired end state.
- Include preconditions and “do not act if…” cases.
- Give concrete examples.
- Prefer one change per task.
- Use tests as the success condition.
- Ask the agent what was missing from the prompt after runs.
- Version-control larger prompts because they can be tested and evaluated. citeturn202967view0

They found Claude Code performs better with outcome-oriented prompts, while their earlier homegrown loop needed more rigid step-by-step prompts. citeturn202967view0

### 8. They are moving beyond PRs

Honk originally produced PRs. Spotify now sees that as too narrow.

In the transcript, Niklas says Honk is still somewhat constrained: mostly one-shot, mostly expecting PR output. Spotify is working on a newer generation that is multi-turn and can produce multiple PRs, no PR, incident investigation, data analysis, log analysis, SRE tasks, or runnable prototypes. citeturn770141view0

They also want non-developers to use it. For example, instead of giving a PM a PR, Spotify wants a PM/designer to get an installable mobile app prototype on their device. citeturn770141view0

### 9. The new bottlenecks are CI and code review

Spotify says AI increased code throughput enough that their CI system became overloaded, and code review pressure increased. Developers now have agents working for them, but humans still need to review important changes. citeturn770141view0

Their mitigation stack:

- Stronger CI
- More static analysis
- More lint checks
- Feature flags
- A/B testing
- Reliability tiers by system criticality
- More human judgment for critical systems
- More automated rollout/QA for lower-risk product work citeturn770141view0

Spotify specifically says static analysis and lint checks are efficient feedback loops for agents because agents understand those guardrails better than loose human guidelines. citeturn770141view0

## The model in one sentence

Spotify is using **Backstage as the map**, **Fleet Management as the execution substrate**, **Claude/Honk as the code-changing worker**, and **verification loops + CI + feature flags + human accountability** as the safety layer.

## What this means for Jovie

The Jovie-equivalent architecture should be:

```text
Linear / docs / product intent
        ↓
GBrain context layer
        ↓
Agent task planner
        ↓
Repo-aware coding agent
        ↓
Verifier harness: typecheck, lint, tests, build, screenshots, evals
        ↓
PR / preview deployment / Linear update
        ↓
Human approval
        ↓
Production behind flags
```

The key lesson: do not just “add agents.” Build the harness where agents can repeatedly produce safe, reviewable work. Spotify’s leverage came from the boring platform layer first.
