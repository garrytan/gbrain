windusrf sucks at updating

Mr. White — it sounds like you’re frustrated with entity["software", "Windsurf", 0]’s update experience, and your point is valid.

Here’s a summary of what the situation appears to be, and some possible work-arounds for you:

---

### ✅ What’s working (i.e., updates are happening)  
- The Windsurf changelog shows very frequent releases (e.g., versions 1.12.39 on December 4, 2025; 1.12.37 on December 2) indicating active development. citeturn0search0turn0search2turn0search1  
- The docs note that you can update via UI (“Restart to Update →” button) or via “Check for Updates” in Command Palette. citeturn0search4  

---

### ⚠️ What’s frustrating / potentially problematic  
- Users report that the update-restart loop is disruptive:  
  > “There are like 3 updates per week… I have long running processes in the editor terminal … When I restart the editor, I have to manually restart these processes.” citeturn0search8  
- Some updates apparently may be blocked by environment/setup issues:  
  > “Updates are disabled because you are running the user-scope installation of Windsurf as Administrator. We cannot auto-update Windsurf when it is run as Administrator.” citeturn0search5  
- If you want to stay on a previous version (because updates break something) you need to switch “Update: Mode” to manual or none. citeturn0search2

### 🔍 Potential solutions for you  
Since you’re a startup founder likely working with code and long sessions, these may help:

1. **Switch update mode to manual**  
   In the settings of Windsurf you can set Update Mode = *manual* (or *none*) so you control when to restart. This gives you stability and control. citeturn0search2turn0search3  

2. **Check your installation scope**  
   If you installed it with admin privileges / user-scope mismatch this may block auto-updates. Try running as non-Administrator or reinstall with correct privileges so updates can apply smoothly. citeturn0search5  

3. **Schedule restarts at convenient times**  
   Since updates require restart, try to tie them to your natural workflow breaks so the interruption is minimized (e.g., after finishing a push, not mid-terminal session).  

4. **Backup or snapshot your workspace / terminal sessions**  
   If you have long running dev servers or terminals, consider snapshotting or scripting their restart so updates don’t cause undue disruption.  

5. **Provide feedback to Windsurf**  
   If this frequent restart/update pattern is a pain point, you might reach out to the team or check the feature request forum—users have flagged this behaviour already. citeturn0search8turn0search3

If you like, I can check **which specific version** you’re on vs latest, and **whether any major issues** are reported for the version you’re forced into by auto-update — so you can decide whether to delay updates or not. Would you like me to pull that up?
