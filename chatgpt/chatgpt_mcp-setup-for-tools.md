## User

Can i set up mcp in my project for the various tools i need like clerk, neon, stripe, and vercel all in one file and have codex, claude code, cursor, copilot, etc all use them? Or do i have to install each separately for each tools

## Assistant

Short answer:  

- **Yes**, you can absolutely have *one* MCP server/file that wraps Clerk, Neon, Stripe, Vercel, etc.  
- **No**, you *can’t* configure it once and have Codex / Claude Code / Cursor / Copilot magically share it. Each of those clients needs its **own MCP config entry**, but they can all point to the **same server**.

Let’s break it down.

---

## 1. One MCP server, many tools (Clerk, Neon, Stripe, Vercel)

MCP is just a client–server protocol:

- **Server**: exposes “tools” (functions) like `createStripeCheckout`, `queryNeonDb`, `getClerkUser`, `triggerVercelDeploy`. citeturn0search0turn0search8  
- **Client**: your IDE/agent (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, etc.) that connects to those tools and calls them.

So you can absolutely:

- Write **one MCP server** (e.g. `server.ts` or `server.py`)  
- Inside it, wire up all your integrations:
  - Stripe SDK
  - Neon/Postgres client
  - Clerk SDK / REST
  - Vercel REST/CLI
- Expose each integration as one or more MCP tools from that single process.

You do **not** need “one MCP server per API” unless you want that for organization.

Think of it like a mini backend:

```text
mcp-server (one process)
  ├─ tool: stripe_create_payment_intent
  ├─ tool: neon_query_sql
  ├─ tool: clerk_get_user
  └─ tool: vercel_deploy
```

---

## 2. Why each client still needs its own config

Where it gets confusing is **client configuration**.

Each MCP client has its own config file / format where you **declare which MCP servers to connect to**:

- **Claude Desktop / Claude Code**  
  Uses `claude_desktop_config.json` and an `mcpServers` block where you list your servers. citeturn0search3  

- **VS Code GitHub Copilot (MCP)**  
  Uses `.vscode/mcp.json` (workspace) or user settings to add MCP servers. Same server can be reused across workspaces. citeturn0search2  

- **Cursor**  
  Has its own MCP server settings (they support MCP transports and server configs similar to the spec). citeturn0search4  

- **OpenAI Codex (IDE/CLI)**  
  Uses `~/.codex/config.toml` for MCP config, shared between CLI and IDE extension, and you add your MCP servers there. citeturn0search10  

- **Others (Continue, Copilot Studio, etc.)**  
  Also have their own `mcpServers`–style config sections. citeturn0search14turn0search12  

So:

- You **implement your MCP server once** (with all your tools).
- Then **for each client** (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Codex…), you add **one config block** that says:  
  “Here’s an MCP server named `my-app-tools` available at `stdio` / `http` / whatever.”

You **don’t** need to reinstall Stripe/Neon/Clerk/Vercel for every tool/IDE.  
You **do** need to tell each IDE “connect to this MCP server”.

---

## 3. Practical mental model

For your use case, a good setup is:

1. **Repo-level MCP server**  
   - `apps/mcp-server/server.ts` (or similar)
   - Exposes tools:
     - `auth_getUser` (Clerk)
     - `db_query` (Neon)
     - `billing_createCheckout` (Stripe)
     - `deploy_trigger` (Vercel)

2. **Configs per client, all pointing at that one server**  

   - Claude: entry in `claude_desktop_config.json` called `"my-app-tools"`.
   - VS Code Copilot: `.vscode/mcp.json` with `"my-app-tools"`.
   - Cursor: add `"my-app-tools"` via its MCP settings.
   - Codex: entry in `~/.codex/config.toml` for `"my-app-tools"`.

Once that’s done, *every* client can call the same tools and you have **one canonical implementation** in your project.

## 4. Direct answer to your question

> Can I set up MCP in my project for the various tools I need…all in one file and have codex, claude code, cursor, copilot, etc all use them?

- **Yes**: one MCP server/file can wrap all your APIs.
- **Yes**: Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot can all use *that same server*.

> Or do I have to install each separately for each tools?

- You **don’t** have to install/implement each integration per-client.
- You **do** have to **register the same MCP server in each client’s config** once.

If you tell me your stack (Node/TS vs Python), I can sketch a minimal MCP server file that wires up one of those APIs (e.g., Stripe + Neon) as a starting point.
