## User

If I get ChatGPT Pro, the like $200 a month one, it says unlimited access to all of the models and everything. Does that include API access? Can I use it? And does that include Claude code? Not Claude code, Jesus, Codex? Does it include Codex? And how do I, and or like if I bring my API key and plug it into Windsurf, does it include then unlimited access to use it in Windsurf? And then finally, what does the pro model get me that the other models don't get me? And is the pro model better than, is 5.2 Pro better than 5.2 Codex?

## Assistant

Mr. White — **ChatGPT Pro ($200/mo) does *not* include unlimited API usage.** ChatGPT subscriptions and the API are billed separately. citeturn0search3turn0search12

### 1) “Unlimited access” — what it actually means
That “unlimited” language is about **using models inside the ChatGPT product** (chatgpt.com), subject to abuse/automation guardrails. citeturn0search0turn0search4  
It’s *not* “unlimited tokens on the API.”

### 2) API access + Windsurf (bringing your API key)
- You **can** use your OpenAI API key in Windsurf (or any other client), **but it’s standard API billing per token**—not unlimited. citeturn0search3  
- Your ChatGPT Pro subscription **doesn’t convert** API calls into “free/unlimited,” and it doesn’t inherently bundle API credits. citeturn0search3turn0search9  
- API rate limits are handled on the API side (usage tiers / limits), not by your ChatGPT message limits. citeturn2search1

### 3) Claude / “Claude Code”
No — **ChatGPT Pro doesn’t include Anthropic Claude or Claude Code.** That’s a separate company/product with separate billing.

### 4) Codex (yes) — what’s included
Yes: **Pro includes Codex** (including the Codex agent / Codex clients that sign in with your ChatGPT plan). citeturn0search1turn0search4turn0search8

### 5) What Pro gets you vs other ChatGPT plans
From OpenAI’s plan description, Pro adds (relative to Plus and below):  
- **“Pro reasoning” with GPT-5**  
- **Unlimited messages/uploads** (guardrails apply)  
- **Maximum deep research + agent mode**  
- **Maximum memory/context**  
- **Expanded projects/tasks/custom GPTs**  
- **Extended Sora access**  
- **Expanded Codex agent + research previews** citeturn0search4turn0search0

### 6) “Is 5.2 Pro better than 5.2 Codex?”
They’re optimized for different things, so “better” depends on the job:

- **GPT-5.2-Codex**: tuned for **agentic coding** (long-horizon changes, refactors/migrations, repo-scale work, stronger defensive security posture). citeturn1search0turn1search3turn1search2  
- **GPT-5 Pro / GPT-5.2 Pro**: tuned for **hard reasoning / precision** (the “think harder” option). citeturn1search6turn1search4turn1search12  

**Rule of thumb:**  
- Writing code across a real repo / multi-step coding agent work → **5.2-Codex** citeturn1search0turn1search2  
- Dense analysis, proofs, tricky planning, “I need the model to think harder” → **5.x Pro** citeturn1search6turn1search12  

If you tell me your exact Windsurf workflow (chat-style help vs autonomous repo changes vs code review), I’ll tell you which model to default to and when to switch.

Yeah, so I'm like currently paying for Cursor, windsurf, at the $200 a month Claude Max plan. I have ChatGPT Plus. I have CodeRabbit. I've got a Sentry agent. I've got Linear. So I'm using a shit ton of these fucking tools. And I guess I'm just curious, is like... I'm just curious if It makes sense for me to get GPT-5 or to get ChatGPT Pro. I guess I don't, you know, I don't know. At this point, I think Claude code seems to run better than Codex in my experience, but I don't know. I do think that the models can sometimes, for some things, be better on ChatGPT, which is why I like running them off, like one-off jobs in windsurf through the GPT-5 codex, or 5.2 codex, or 5.2 high or something, or X-high for like planning and stuff like that. But I generally find that like day-to-day coding is far more efficient with Claude code because of its use of sub-agents and slash commands and pre-commit hooks and and edit after edit hooks and stuff like that. Um, whereas codex seems to be behind on that stuff. Codex I primarily use as like an agent in linear to like assign a task to and then let it go off and do its thing in the cloud. Um, what I find codex a little annoying because I always have to go in and like to the web interface to get it to pull a PR for some reason. It never automatically wants to open a PR. Um, shit like that.
