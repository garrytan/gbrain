## User

Yo dawg, I got this T-Mobile Internet modem with like the 5G at-home internet shit and every couple days it like just seems to kick out and stops working and then I go and tether it in my phone, which is on T-Mobile and I'm able to connect fine. So it's like can't be a network outage I would assume and It seems to me like it's like either a memory leak on the hardware that's fixed with a reboot or something like that Do you know what's going on?

Mr. White, here’s what usually makes a T-Mobile 5G Home Internet gateway go AWOL every few days—and the quickest fixes:

**Why it happens**

| Likely culprit | What’s really going on |
| --- | --- |
| **Buggy firmware / memory-leak** | A bad firmware push last winter caused random lock-ups and drops on the Nokia, Arcadyan and Sagemcom units. The gateway’s NAT/RAM fills up and the radio stack crashes until you reboot. citeturn4search0 |
| **Overheating** | The radios throttle or shut down if the modem is jammed in a cabinet or sun-baked window. |
| **Tower or band hand-off glitch** | The gateway sometimes latches onto a weak LTE anchor band and refuses to roam, while your phone quietly flips to a clean n41 5G slice. |
| **IPv6/NAT table overflow** | Heavy home traffic plus T-Mobile’s CG-NAT can exhaust sessions faster than the gateway clears them. |

**Fast fixes**

1. **Check & update firmware**  
   Open the T-Life app → **More › Gateway info › Software**. If an update is waiting, install it; most units should now be on versions ending **.04xx**. If you’re stuck on an older build, call support and ask for a “forced FW push”. citeturn6view0

2. **Give it a daily power-cycle** (band-aid but works)  
   Plug the gateway into a $10 smart plug and schedule a 3 a.m. off/on. People running Arcadyan KVD21s report 100 % uptime after doing this. citeturn0search3

3. **Keep it cool & upright**  
   Vent all sides; aim a cheap USB fan at it if the shell feels hot.

4. **Lock to the clean band** (optional tweak)  
   In the web GUI → **Network › Cell** lock to n41 only. If signal is ≥ -100 dBm / SINR > 10 dB you’ll avoid the flaky LTE fallback.

5. **Kill IPv6**  
   In **Network › LAN**, disable IPv6. This stops some session-table overflows on older firmware.

6. **Still dropping? Swap hardware**  
   Ask T-Mobile for the new FAST 5688W “G5AR” gateway—it runs a newer chipset and the disconnect bug hasn’t shown up on it yet.

That’s it—update, auto-reboot, cool it, and you’ll probably stop babysitting the thing.
