CocoaPods is a **dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C projects** on Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS). It lets you declare third-party libraries in a text file and then handles downloading them, resolving versions, and wiring everything into an Xcode workspace for you. citeturn0search2turn0search1  

### What it actually does

- You list libraries in a `Podfile` (e.g. Alamofire, Firebase, etc.). citeturn0search1  
- CocoaPods:
  - Resolves versions and transitive dependencies  
  - Downloads sources from Git, SVN, HTTP archives, etc. citeturn0search5  
  - Creates/updates a `Pods` project and an `.xcworkspace` that you open instead of the original `.xcodeproj`. citeturn0search3  

Rough minimal `Podfile` example: citeturn0search2  

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'Alamofire', '~> 5.9'
end
```

Then:

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods   # once, to install the tool
pod init                     # in your project folder
pod install                  # installs the pods & creates .xcworkspace
```

### Status in 2025 (important context)

- It’s still widely used (React Native, many legacy iOS apps) but **the project is effectively in maintenance mode** — new work is mostly Xcode compatibility + security fixes. citeturn0search9turn0search7  
- Apple’s **Swift Package Manager (SPM)** is the modern, “native” alternative; new pure-Swift projects typically prefer SPM, while CocoaPods remains common for existing codebases and some frameworks that still ship as pods. citeturn0search7turn0academia11  

### Security note

In 2024, several **supply-chain vulnerabilities** were disclosed in CocoaPods’ infrastructure (unclaimed pods, trunk issues) which could have allowed malicious code injection; these have been patched but they highlighted risk in older ecosystems with huge dependency graphs. citeturn0search9turn0academia12

If you tell me what you want to do with CocoaPods (set it up, migrate to SPM, create your own pod, deal with CI, etc.), I can walk you through concrete commands and file snippets.
