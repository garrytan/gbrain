Yeah, for coding, I just have a question about when Surf is credit-based, and I routinely have like back and forth where it's like one change, or like I'll ask a question, and then you're firing off another message. You're gonna charge per message whether it's like a four-hour refactor or a single response to a question. The same credit usage seems not like ideal pricing. Cloud code, I think they like for usage-based and it's not per prompt. And then like codex and stuff is like API token-based. My understanding of this pricing incorrect. Is there a way to make WindSurf more efficient? Should I be bringing my own keys for WindSurf? Because if I'm paying for my credit to just to answer a clarifying question or something seems absurd.

Mr. White — your understanding is mostly right **for Windsurf/Cascade**: it’s **credit-based per message (prompt)**, not “hours of work,” and not purely token-metered like using an API directly.

### How Windsurf credits actually work (Cascade)
- **Prompt credits are consumed whenever you send a message to Cascade using a premium model.** Each model can have a **credit multiplier**, with the “default” being **1 credit per message**. citeturn1view0  
- **The number of internal steps/actions Cascade takes (searching files, editing, running tools) does *not* increase the credit cost**—you’re paying for the *initial prompt*, not each action. citeturn4view2  
- **If a message fails**, credits **aren’t consumed**. citeturn1view0  
- **Monthly prompt credits reset** each billing cycle and **don’t roll over**, while **add-on credits** (purchased) **can carry over until used**. citeturn1view0  

### So yes: a clarifying question can “cost the same” as a big refactor
If you’re using a premium model for both, they’re both “a message,” so they both draw credits. That’s the tradeoff of predictability vs usage-metering.

### Ways to make Windsurf more efficient (practical)
1. **Use Windsurf Command for back-and-forth / small edits**
   - Windsurf’s own docs explicitly say **Command does not consume premium model credits**. citeturn7view2  
   - In practice: use Cascade for “big plan + multi-file work,” then use Command for tight iteration loops.

2. **Switch to a 0-credit model for clarifications**
   - Windsurf notes there are **models that cost 0 credits** you can use in Write/Chat mode when you want to reduce consumption. citeturn4view2  
   - Strategy: do “design/architecture” in premium, then flip to 0-credit for clarifying Qs and small adjustments.

3. **Force “batch clarifications”**
   - Tell Cascade: *“Before you change anything, ask me all clarifying questions in one message.”*
   - This cuts the expensive ping-pong where each tiny follow-up is another paid prompt.

4. **Front-load context to avoid follow-ups**
   - Provide: goal, constraints, files to touch, “don’t touch” areas, acceptance criteria, and examples. Fewer clarifiers needed.

### Should you bring your own keys (BYOK)?
Windsurf supports **BYOK for certain models**, and the docs list the currently supported BYOK models as:
- **Claude 4 Sonnet** (+ Thinking)
- **Claude 4 Opus** (+ Thinking) citeturn1view1turn7view3  

And you add the key via their provider API keys page in subscription settings. citeturn1view1turn7view3  

**Whether BYOK reduces Windsurf credit usage depends on how Windsurf is metering that specific path in your account.** The docs clearly explain *how to enable BYOK* but don’t explicitly state (in the sections above) whether BYOK prompts consume Windsurf prompt credits in addition to your provider’s billing. citeturn1view1turn7view3  
Best way to verify fast: send one short BYOK message and check your **“Cascade Usage”** panel before/after. citeturn1view0  

### Bottom line
- Your complaint is valid: **per-message pricing makes “clarify” feel expensive**.
- The best immediate fix is usually: **Command for iteration + 0-credit models for clarification + batching questions**. citeturn7view2turn4view2  
- BYOK can be worth it if you want **true usage-based billing** (especially for bursty months), but confirm the credit behavior in your own usage panel. citeturn1view0turn1view1  

If you tell me which models you’re using (and whether you’re mostly in Cascade vs Command), I’ll suggest a tight “default workflow” that minimizes paid prompts.

What the hell is windsurf command, and how do I do that? And how many credits does it use?

Mr. White — **Windsurf Command** is the **inline “do this edit” AI** that works *inside the editor* (and there’s also a Command mode in the terminal). It’s separate from **Cascade** (the chat/agent panel).

## What it is
- **Command = inline code generation/edits** from a natural-language instruction, directly where your cursor is (or on a selected block). citeturn0search2turn0search11  
- **It does NOT consume premium/prompt credits.** citeturn0search2turn0search11  
  - So in terms of “credits”: **0 prompt credits per Command use** (per Windsurf docs). citeturn0search2turn0search11  

## How to use it (editor)
1. **Select code** you want changed (optional).
2. Press **Cmd+I (Mac)** / **Ctrl+I (Win/Linux)**. citeturn0search2turn0search11  
3. Type your instruction (e.g., “Refactor this into a pure function; add tests”).
4. Submit with the UI button or **Cmd+Enter / Ctrl+Enter**. citeturn0search11  
5. Use the controls above the diff to **Accept / Reject / Follow-up** (there are also shortcuts shown in the docs). citeturn0search11  

## Why this helps your “credit burn” problem
Use **Cascade** only when you need multi-step reasoning / repo-wide changes. Use **Command** for the rapid back-and-forth micro-edits that would otherwise cost you **one credit per chat message** in Cascade.

If you tell me your OS (Mac/Windows) and whether you’re mostly editing in-editor vs chatting in Cascade, I’ll give you a tight workflow to minimize paid prompts.
