## User

talk to me about tanstack products, whats used widely and what isnt and if the products have any overlap

---

## Assistant

Here’s a concise breakdown of **TanStack products**, what’s *widely adopted* in real-world apps, where they *overlap*, and what’s newer or less common.

---

## 🧰 Core TanStack Libraries (and Usage

### 1) **TanStack Query** (Very widely used)
- Formerly **React Query** — arguably the most popular TanStack library. citeturn0search1turn0search33
- Purpose: data fetching + caching + async state management. citeturn0search20
- Works across React, Vue, Solid, Svelte, Angular, etc. citeturn0search1
- Status: *de facto standard* for API data management in React apps. citeturn0search33

> **Why it’s popular**  
> automatic caching, refetching, mutations, cache invalidation, retries, SSR support — without managing global state manually. citeturn0search20

---

### 2) **TanStack Table** (Very widely used)
- A headless table/datagrid engine with sorting/filtering/pagination/etc. citeturn0search8
- Lightweight and flexible; UI is up to you. citeturn0search26
- Extremely common in data-heavy UIs (e.g., admin panels). citeturn0search5

> **Reality check**  
> Documentation for the latest versions is sometimes cited as lacking, though adoption remains high. citeturn0search5

---

### 3) **TanStack Router** (Growing adoption)
- Full-featured, fully type-safe router for React/Solid. citeturn0search19
- Includes nested routes, loaders, prefetching, SSR support, search-param APIs. citeturn0search19
- Less ubiquitous than React Router yet gaining traction, especially in TypeScript projects. citeturn0search17

---

## 🆕 / Emerging TanStack Tools

### 4) **TanStack Start**
- A full-stack framework built on Router + Vite. citeturn0search14
- Offers SSR, streaming, server-functions.
- Emerging alternative to frameworks like Next.js; adoption early but increasing. citeturn0search24

### 5) **TanStack DB** (Beta)
- A **client-first reactive store** with live queries and sub-millisecond updates. citeturn0search21
- Newer and less battle-tested compared with Query/Tabl​e.

### 6) **TanStack Form**
- Headless form state manager with strong TypeScript. citeturn0search35
- Less mainstream than libraries like Formik/React Hook Form, but gaining as a native TanStack piece.

### 7) **TanStack Virtual**
- Headless virtualization engine (large lists/grids). citeturn0search39
- Useful but niche compared to core Query/Table functionality.

### 8) **TanStack Devtools**
- Unified devtools panel for TanStack tools; low adoption currently (alpha). citeturn0search2

### 9) **TanStack AI** (New)
- Provides an AI SDK abstraction layer; adoption early/experimental. citeturn0search16

## 🔁 Overlap & Where They Fit

| Feature Area | Primary Tool | Overlaps With |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Data fetching & caching** | *TanStack Query* | Can complement DB live queries |
| **Table/Datagrid logic** | *TanStack Table* | Works with Virtual for performance |
| **Routing** | *TanStack Router* | Integrates with Query for data loaders |
| **State management** | *TanStack DB* | DB vs Query: DB is local reactive store; Query is server cache |
| **Forms** | *TanStack Form* | Some overlap with client state libs |
| **Virtual lists** | *TanStack Virtual* | Overlap only in performance optimization |

- **Query vs DB:** Query handles remote async data; DB focuses on reactive local collections. citeturn0search21
- **Router & Query:** Router doesn’t replace Query but often *integrates* with it for loader caching. citeturn0search19
- **Form vs local state libs:** Overlap with things like React Hook Form but TanStack Form emphasizes type safety. citeturn0search35

## User

for our stack next.js on vercel with drizzle kit and neon and clerk and stripe for a world class blazing fast linkin bio app what should we use if any

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — for your **Next.js on Vercel + Drizzle + Neon + Clerk + Stripe** stack (building a *blazing fast link-in-bio app*), here’s what from the TanStack ecosystem makes sense:

### 🧠 What to Use
**1) TanStack Query — yes**
- Use for **data fetching, caching, mutations**, and stale-while-revalidate UX.
- Even with server actions/Drizzle, Query shines for client caching and optimistic updates.

**2) TanStack Router — optional**
- Next.js **app router** already handles routing nicely.
- Only adopt TanStack Router if you want **fully type-safe, nested loaders/fetchers** that integrate with Query; otherwise stick with Next.js routing.

**3) TanStack Table — conditional**
- Use only if you **render complex tabular data** (e.g., analytics dashboards).
- If your UI mostly lists links and stats, native components + simple UI libs are fine.

**4) TanStack Form — optional**
- Good if you want **TypeScript-centric form state and validation**.
- Otherwise Clerk’s UI + minimal state might suffice.

**5) TanStack Virtual — yes, for lists**
- If your link dashboard has long lists/analytics, Virtual improves performance.

### 🧩 How It Fits Your Stack
**Fetching/Mutations**
- **Server Actions** (Next.js) for writes that go straight to Drizzle/Neon.
- **TanStack Query** on the client to:
  - cache GET endpoints
  - sync UI state
  - orchestrate background refetches
  - do optimistic updates (e.g., reorder links)

**Server Components vs Client**
- Keep most UI in Server Components where possible.
- Use **Query in Client Components** for interactive parts (modals, upserts, status).

**Routing**
- Next.js App Router typically outperforms adding another routing layer.
- Skip TanStack Router unless you want **deep nested route APIs + loaders** over Next.js fetchers.

**Forms**
- If you need vanilla form logic → use TanStack Form.
- If it’s simple (create/edit link), basic React state/select + native validation is fine.

### 📈 Summary
Use this minimal set:
- ✅ **TanStack Query** — for client data sync/fetch
- ✅ **TanStack Virtual** — for performance lists
- ⚪ **TanStack Table** — only if you need advanced grid features
- ⚪ **TanStack Form** — for advanced form control
- ❌ **TanStack Router** — lean on Next.js routing

This keeps your stack **tight, fast, and idiomatic** for Next.js on Vercel with your existing backend setup.

## User

we use analytics but dont really have long lsits

---

## Assistant

Understood, Mr. White. Given **analytics but no long lists**, here’s the tightened recommendation:

### What to Use (and Skip)

**✅ TanStack Query — Use**
- Best fit for your stack.
- Handles analytics fetches, cache, background refresh, and mutations cleanly.
- Complements Next.js Server Actions without fighting them.
- Ideal for stats cards, charts, and near-real-time updates.

**❌ TanStack Virtual — Skip**
- No long lists = no payoff.
- Adds complexity without measurable gains.

**❌ TanStack Table — Skip**
- Overkill unless you have sortable/filterable grids.
- Analytics cards + charts don’t benefit from it.

**❌ TanStack Router — Skip**
- entity["framework","Next.js","react framework"] App Router already gives you:
  - Streaming
  - Layouts
  - Route-level caching
- TanStack Router would be redundant.

**⚪ TanStack Form — Optional**
- Only worth it if:
  - You have complex, dynamic forms
  - You want extreme TypeScript guarantees
- For basic link editing, simple React state or lightweight validation is faster.

### Final Stack Call
For a **world-class, blazing-fast link-in-bio app** on entity["platform","Vercel","cloud platform"]:

- **Core TanStack usage:**  
  → **entity["javascript_library","TanStack Query","async state management"] only**

Everything else adds surface area without ROI for your current product shape.

If you want, I can give you a **clean Query + Server Actions pattern** tuned specifically for Drizzle + Neon + analytics reads.
