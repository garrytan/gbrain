**CodeRabbit “auto-fix”** refers to the **AI-powered automatic suggestion and application of code corrections** as part of CodeRabbit’s code review workflow.

**What it does**
- CodeRabbit **automatically reviews code** (in pull requests or in your IDE) using AI and static analysis. It flags bugs, stylistic issues, security concerns, and maintainability suggestions. citeturn0search3turn0search7
- When it finds **simple, safe fixes**, it generates **ready-to-apply patch suggestions** that you can accept with a **one-click “fix”** action in the interface. citeturn0search6
- In IDEs like **VS Code**, simple suggested fixes can be applied instantly via the extension’s **one-click fix** button. citeturn0search1

**How “auto-fix” works in practice**
- **Pull Request reviews:** When a PR is opened, CodeRabbit runs a review and posts comments with fix suggestions. You can click *Apply suggestion* to incorporate those fixes directly into the code. citeturn0search15
- **IDE workflow:** Within your editor, CodeRabbit highlights issues and provides a one-click apply option for straightforward corrections. Complex changes can be handed off to a connected AI coding agent. citeturn0search6
- **Automatic thread resolution:** Newer features let CodeRabbit **detect when a suggested change has been implemented** and automatically resolve its related review thread. citeturn0search18

**What it isn’t**
- It’s not a fully autonomous bug fixer that rewrites large features on its own — fixes still require acceptance by a dev. It suggests and applies appropriate small corrections; larger or complex changes are suggested and may be assisted by an AI agent. citeturn0search19

In short, CodeRabbit **auto-fix** is the platform’s feature to generate and let you apply automated corrective patches for code issues it finds during AI-assisted code reviews. citeturn0search3
