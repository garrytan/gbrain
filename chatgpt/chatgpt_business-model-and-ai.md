Concisely talk to me about numbers. Let's look at Jovie, let's look at our business model here: $39 a month, $299 a month. Let's run through every single path we could go through. That business model might be incorrect, like pricing might be incorrect. We are AI that identifies revenue opportunities and then executes on them for artists. Human in the loop to start, eventually a completely closed-loop operating system for music creators that could then become content businesses.
We could go: we do this for music. It's the same exact stuff to drive a link to Spotify for a song as it is to drive a link to Spotify for a podcast. We expand into podcasts, right? Or if you've got podcasts that are doing stuff on YouTube and shit, it's easy enough to handle YouTube creators because we already kind of handle that. Music kind of gives you the platform coverage to be able to pivot into all these adjacent things. That's one way. Just taking merch is another way. I don't know that that's the business I wanna be in, but I want to be in a business that makes money, so that's the answer. I'll take it.
It could be we just become distribution and then we take a percentage, and we don't even charge people for it. If you're on our distribution, or maybe we only do that with select artists or something. Maybe we start a label or something. We believe that we can actually drive revenue to music catalogs. Why not have artists?
Also, I've always wanted to build an army of virtual artists with music made by real humans in L.A. That's something I'll probably end up doing just for fun: put together a team of Max Martins, open a studio in L.A., put them all on a fucking publishing deal, and then just have them churn out music for virtual acts that we create with AI. Sounds like a fucking great time to me. That could also be a thing where we start selling this to fucking Netflix or something. I don't know, seems like there's a million different ways we can go with this.
We could buy legacy catalogs, which I do believe are probably going to be more valuable as you dilute the market with music from Suno and stuff. I think more and more people are going to be valuing. There's no reason that Frank Sinatra shouldn't be making TikTok videos. That's kind of where I'm getting at. If you can buy the legacy right, it's like, why are the Backstreet Boys the Backstreet Boys? They could take all of their stems, hand them over to Suno, and do one of two things:
1. Publicly let anyone on Suno just make songs with the Backstreet Boys' voices, earn a cut of that as a licensing deal.
2. Start releasing songs or start signing the songs that pop off that are Backstreet Boys songs and release them as actual Backstreet Boys songs, and then AI with Higgs field or something, see dance and shit, the fucking music video for it.

I’ll treat this as a pricing and path-selection exercise: model each route by revenue mechanics, gross margin, CAC/payback risk, and strategic upside, then rank the paths numerically.

Early read: $39 should be self-serve or onboarding/data capture, while human execution belongs in $299+, rev-share, or enterprise. Distribution is better as a wedge or take-rate engine.

Mr. White — Jovie should be priced around **revenue under management**, with SaaS as the entry fee.

## 1. Current pricing math

| Plan | MRR / customer | ARR / customer | What it can support |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Base | $39 | $468 | Pure software, no human ops |
| Pro | $299 | $3,588 | Light managed execution |
| Agency/Label | $999–$5,000+ | $12k–$60k+ | Human + automation + revenue share |

At $39, you need self-serve onboarding, automation, and near-zero service burden. At $299, you can afford light human-in-the-loop execution. Assuming $50/hour fully loaded ops cost, one hour/month already eats 17% of a $299 plan and 128% of a $39 plan.

Distribution pricing anchors are very low: DistroKid starts around $24.99/year, TuneCore says unlimited releases start at $24.99/year, UnitedMasters SELECT is $59.99/year, and CD Baby uses one-time release fees plus a 9% digital distribution commission. So $39/month only works if Jovie is sold as a **revenue operator**, not as distribution software. citeturn385932search4turn385932search2turn385932search7turn385932search1

## 2. Rev-share break-even

If you replace subscription with take-rate:

| Jovie take rate | Equals $39/mo when artist makes | Equals $299/mo when artist makes |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 10% | $390/mo | $2,990/mo |
| 15% | $260/mo | $1,993/mo |
| 20% | $195/mo | $1,495/mo |

This says:

$39 is a good long-tail access fee.

$299 is good for artists already making or plausibly able to make **$1.5k–$3k/month**.

Rev-share is best for select artists, catalogs, merch, sync, brand deals, and distribution-controlled revenue.

## 3. Core business paths

| Path | Model | Revenue potential | Main issue |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Artist SaaS | $39–$299/mo | 10k customers at blended $75/mo = $9M ARR | Churn, low willingness to pay |
| Managed artist growth | $299–$999/mo | 3k customers at $299 = $10.8M ARR | Ops cost |
| Distribution | Free/cheap + 10–15% royalties | $100M royalties under management at 10% = $10M revenue | Commodity unless Jovie drives upside |
| Label services | 15–30% of revenue Jovie touches | 500 artists doing $50k/year each at 20% = $5M/year | Need selection discipline |
| Merch / commerce | 10–25% of gross profit | 1k artists × 100 orders/mo × $12 GP × 20% = $2.9M/year | Operational mess |
| Podcasts / YouTube creators | $299/mo + 10–20% upside | 1k creators at $299 = $3.6M ARR before rev-share | Different buyer, same workflow |
| Catalog growth operator | 10–30% of incremental revenue | 100 catalogs with $100k/year uplift × 20% = $2M/year | Attribution |
| Catalog acquisition | Buy rights, grow income | Venture-scale if Jovie reliably lifts catalog value | Capital intensive |
| Virtual artists | Own IP + publishing + masters | Huge upside, hit-driven | Studio economics, taste risk |
| Enterprise rights-holder OS | $5k–$25k/mo | 50 customers at $10k/mo = $6M ARR | Slower sales |

## 4. Best pricing architecture

Use four layers:

**Free scan**  
“Jovie found $X in possible revenue opportunities.” This creates the hook.

**$39/month — Autopilot**  
AI monitoring, opportunity detection, campaign suggestions, lightweight execution. No human work.

**$299/month — Operator**  
Human-in-loop execution: campaigns, link routing, content prompts, playlist/UGC/social/merch actions. This plan needs to produce visible revenue or time savings.

**Jovie Select — no fixed fee or $999+/mo + rev-share**  
For artists/catalogs where Jovie controls execution and can measure upside. Terms could be 10–20% of gross revenue flowing through Jovie or 20–30% of incremental revenue Jovie creates.

## 5. Music versus podcasts/YouTube

Music is the right wedge because it forces multi-platform coverage: Spotify, Apple, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, merch, email, Shopify, Discord, tour links, fan data.

Podcast and YouTube expansion makes numerical sense because monetization is easier to attribute. YouTube publicly describes 55% creator ad revenue share for long-form and 45% for Shorts; Spotify’s podcast/video creator monetization includes ad revenue and Premium video revenue through its Partner Program. citeturn419348search4turn419348search6turn419348search2

So the expansion path is:

**Artists → music catalogs → video podcasts → YouTube creators → content businesses.**

Same operating system. Different revenue objects.

## 6. Distribution path

Distribution alone is weak because competitors are cheap. Distribution plus revenue execution is strong.

The reason to become distribution:

You get royalty data.

You get attribution.

You get payment rails.

You can take rev-share.

You can offer advances.

You can select winners.

Spotify pays rightsholders based on streamshare, with recording and publishing royalties flowing through rightsholders, distributors, labels, publishers, societies, and agencies depending on rights structure. Owning distribution pipes gives Jovie a better position inside that money flow. citeturn419348search3turn419348search7

Better model:

**Keep normal distribution cheap/free. Charge for Jovie’s operating layer. Take 10–15% only when you are driving revenue or administering royalty flow.**

## 7. Catalog acquisition path

This is where the numbers get interesting.

Catalog values remain large and active. Citrin Cooperman said its music valuation group priced 566 catalogs worth nearly $13B combined in 2025, and found older masters/catalogs with masters and publishing trading above 17x while publishing traded around 15x. citeturn357627view0 Reuters also reported Sony’s 2026 deal to acquire Recognition Music Group’s catalog at about $4B, with labels and publishers racing to own predictable streaming-era music rights. citeturn357627view2

Basic math:

Buy a catalog earning $100k/year.

At 10x, price = $1M.

At 15x, price = $1.5M.

If Jovie lifts income 30%, revenue becomes $130k/year.

At 15x, mark-to-market value becomes $1.95M.

That is the real upside: **use software to re-rate under-monetized rights.**

Do this before buying:

Run Jovie as a catalog growth operator.

Prove you can lift revenue 10–30%.

Then raise/buy catalogs.

## 8. Virtual artists path

This should be treated as a separate studio business.

Rough studio math:

5 top writers/producers/operators in L.A. = maybe $1M–$2M/year fully loaded.

100 songs/year means each song needs $10k–$20k/year average revenue to break even.

Most songs will fail.

One hit can pay for the whole machine.

This is attractive if Jovie owns masters, publishing, artist IP, visual identity, fan accounts, and merch. The risk profile is label/studio, not SaaS.

The strongest version:

Real humans make the music.

AI creates identities, content velocity, localization, videos, fan interaction, and distribution ops.

Jovie owns or controls the IP stack.

## 9. Legacy artist AI licensing

This could be enormous, but it is rights-heavy.

Two monetization models:

**Open creation license**  
Fans generate sanctioned songs/videos using approved voice/stem/style models. Jovie/rights holder takes fees and downstream revenue.

**A&R marketplace**  
Fans/creators make tracks. The rights holder signs the ones that pop. Jovie handles release, rights, promotion, and monetization.

This is probably an enterprise/catalog product first, not indie artist SaaS.

## 10. My read

Best near-term model:

**$39 self-serve + $299 managed + Jovie Select rev-share.**

Best medium-term model:

**Distribution/payment rails for selected artists so Jovie can take 10–15% and prove revenue lift.**

Best long-term model:

**Rights operating system for music/content IP: catalogs, artists, podcasts, YouTube creators, virtual acts.**

The company should avoid becoming “a merch company,” “a distributor,” or “a label” as the identity. The identity should be:

**Jovie is the AI operator that turns creative IP into revenue.**
