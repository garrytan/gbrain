Failed to create user: Database error creating new user

## Assistant

The error message "Failed to create user: Database error creating new user" in Supabase typically arises from issues with database triggers or functions associated with user creation. This often involves permission problems, misconfigured triggers, or constraints that prevent the insertion of new users.

**Common Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Trigger or Function Errors:**
   - If you've set up a trigger on the `auth.users` table to insert data into another table (e.g., `public.profiles`), ensure that the associated function is correctly defined.
   - The function should be created with the `SECURITY DEFINER` clause to execute with the privileges of the user who created it, typically the `postgres` role.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
     RETURNS trigger AS $$
     BEGIN
       INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email)
       VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.email);
       RETURN NEW;
     END;
     $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
     ```
   - Ensure that the function's `search_path` is set appropriately to prevent security issues.

2. **Permission Issues:**
   - The role executing the trigger (often `supabase_auth_admin`) may lack the necessary permissions to insert into the target table.
   - Using `SECURITY DEFINER` as mentioned above allows the function to execute with elevated privileges.

3. **Constraint Violations:**
   - Check for constraints on the target table (e.g., unique constraints, foreign keys) that might be violated during the insert operation.
   - Ensure that the data being inserted complies with all table constraints.

4. **Debugging Steps:**
   - Review the Postgres logs to identify specific errors during the user creation process.
   - Use the Supabase Dashboard's Auth logs explorer for additional insights.
   - Temporarily disable the trigger to determine if it's the source of the error.

By reviewing and adjusting your triggers, functions, and permissions as outlined above, you should be able to resolve the user creation error in Supabase.
