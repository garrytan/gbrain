Yo, so, I'm just thinking about, uh, um, I'm just thinking about Cursor now, um, and how we can do this, I don't want, um, to run these agents, um, separately, um, I guess I'm just trying to understand, like, flow-wise, because, it's like, so one thing I'm noticing in Cursor is like, the weird behavior is like, it has this built-in review system, that like, doesn't seem to kick in automatically, even though I have it set to kick in automatically, it does feel like I have to like, kind of like, egg it on to do that, and I'm kind of just like, wondering why it like, it runs and then it catches things, and then there's like, and that needs to be fixed, and then you hit the fix button and it inserts that into the chat, and I'm like, why can't I just have it auto-fix, you know, those things, um, and then it does allow you to do these cool things where you can run like, multiple models at the same time, and I think it even lets you like, auto-select the winner, um, that's kind of cool, um, I guess I wish that it was like, more orchestrated, so that it wasn't just like, spinning up a large task against them, and it was just doing like, small tasks against multiple models, and then picking the winners, and then, you know, continuing, um, but, um, I don't know, I guess my main thing is like, we have husky hooks, and it feels like the husky hooks aren't playing nice with, um, cursor, like cursor isn't picking up the failures, it's just throwing these like, dialogue errors, um, and so I'm having cursor convert the husky hooks to native cursor hooks, which I'm hoping will deal with this, I'm wondering if cursor hooks could be used as a way to auto-lint and test and type check, um, and I'm also just curious generally, like, what else, what else we can do, um, you know, to tighten up this flow, um, and I'm wondering.

Mr. White — you’re not crazy; a bunch of what you’re describing lines up with how Cursor is built today *and* with a few known rough edges.

## Why the “review → fix → inserts into chat” loop feels dumb
Cursor’s agent flow is intentionally “human-in-the-loop” around edits in many setups, even when you toggle “run everything / auto.” The friction (review controls, “Keep All”, etc.) is partly a safety/guardrail design choice, and partly that the review UI can be flaky/intermittent right now (there are multiple recent reports of “Keep All / Review next file” issues). citeturn0search7turn0search14turn0search1turn0search4

Practical implication: if you want **true auto-fix**, you’ll get more reliable results by running *deterministic tooling* (format/lint/typecheck/tests) automatically, instead of hoping the review layer always triggers and then auto-applies.

## The Husky ↔ Cursor hook failure is usually an environment/PATH problem
When you commit from inside GUI-ish tools, git hooks often run in a different environment than your terminal (missing `node`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, etc.). This is a classic failure mode with Husky (“command not found”) and it shows up specifically in Cursor commits too. citeturn0search25turn0search2

So you get weird “dialogue errors” instead of clean hook output because the hook process can’t find the runtime it needs (or gets killed / terminated in odd ways). There are also Cursor-specific reports of git hooks being killed. citeturn0search8

## Yes: Cursor Hooks are *exactly* a lever for auto-lint/test/typecheck (agent-loop level)
Cursor introduced **Hooks** to “observe/control/extend the agent loop” via scripts that communicate over stdio/JSON. This is *not* the same thing as Husky (git lifecycle), but it’s perfect for “after agent edits a file, run tooling, and force fixes / stop.” citeturn0search0turn0search6turn0search9

### How I’d “tighten the flow” (best-of-both-worlds)
Think in **two layers**:

1) **Cursor Hooks = fast feedback while the agent is working**
- After-file-edit: run formatter + lint autofix (fast)
- After-task / before-accept: run typecheck (medium)
- Before-commit inside Cursor: run lint-staged + targeted tests (medium)

2) **Git/CI hooks = enforcement**
- Keep Husky (or switch to `pre-commit`, or just CI) as the *source of truth* so bad code can’t land even if someone isn’t using Cursor. citeturn0search13turn0search29

This is the key: **Cursor hooks make it feel smooth; CI makes it correct.**

## Concrete moves that usually fix the pain quickly

### 1) Make your hook commands environment-proof
Inside Husky (or Cursor hooks), prefer commands that don’t depend on a GUI PATH:
- Use `npx --no-install eslint ...` / `pnpm eslint ...` / `node ./node_modules/.bin/eslint ...`
- If you use `yarn`, explicitly ensure it’s available (this is the failure Cursor users report). citeturn0search25

### 2) Use Cursor Hooks to auto-format/auto-fix immediately after edits
Cursor Hooks are script-driven; you can implement:
- “If eslint can autofix → apply fixes”
- “If typecheck fails → stop agent and print errors”
That gives you the auto-fix experience *without* relying on the review UI to behave.

(See Cursor’s Hooks docs for the lifecycle points and the stdio JSON contract.) citeturn0search0

### 3) Split checks by cost so it stays orchestrated
Your “small tasks against multiple models” instinct is right, but you can get 80% of the benefit by orchestrating **checks**:
- On every file edit: prettier + eslint --fix (seconds)
- On “stop” / end of run: `tsc --noEmit` (tens of seconds)
- Only on commit / pre-push: tests (minutes)

### 4) Don’t trust “Auto model select” for determinism
Cursor’s “Auto” model selection exists and can change behavior/run-to-run reliability. If you’re debugging workflow issues, pin a model while you stabilize the pipeline. citeturn0search12turn0search15

### 5) Work around review UI flakiness while you harden the pipeline
If your “Keep All / Review next file” controls stop responding, there are reports that the chat sidebar “Keep All” works when the editor buttons don’t. citeturn0search7

---

If you tell me your stack (Node? TS? Python? monorepo tool like Nx/Turbo? package manager?), I can sketch a very specific “hooks layout” (what runs where + recommended commands) that stays fast and doesn’t depend on Cursor’s review UI behaving.

## User

Are there additional linked things that we should implement that would better clean up the orchestration and shit?

---

## Assistant

Yeah. If you want the workflow to feel *orchestrated* (instead of “big agent run → weird review UI → manual fix buttons”), you basically add **one layer that makes changes deterministic** and **one layer that enforces correctness**.

Here are the highest-ROI “linked” pieces to implement:

## 1) Treat Cursor Hooks as your orchestrator, not the Review UI
Cursor Hooks are designed to “observe/control/extend the agent loop” via scripts (stdio/JSON), which makes them a better place to enforce *automatic* formatting + lint-fix + typecheck gates than the sometimes-flaky review panel. citeturn0search0turn0search6turn0search14

**Pattern**
- **afterFileEdit**: run `format` + `lint --fix` (fast, auto-correcting)
- **beforeStop / onTaskComplete**: run `typecheck` (fail-fast)
- **onError**: dump actionable output back into the agent context

## 2) Move “auto-fix” to deterministic tools: format/lint-staged first
Instead of asking the model to fix style nits:
- Prettier (or equivalent) = always auto
- ESLint `--fix` = mostly auto
- `lint-staged` (or similar) = only touches changed files, stays fast

This gives you the “auto-fix” experience without relying on Cursor review behavior.

## 3) Make your hook commands *environment-proof* (fixes the Husky/Cursor mismatch)
A lot of Husky-in-Cursor pain is simply PATH/runtime mismatch (“yarn not in PATH” etc.). citeturn0search7turn0search1turn0search19

**Do this**
- Prefer `pnpm eslint …` / `npm run lint …` / `node ./node_modules/.bin/eslint …`
- Avoid assuming global `yarn`/`node` exists in GUI hook environments

This applies to **both** Husky and Cursor Hooks.

## 4) Keep enforcement in CI (so Cursor quirks don’t matter)
Even Cursor users have reported hook weirdness / hooks being “killed” / review loops reverting changes. citeturn0search15turn0search18turn0search14

So: **Cursor hooks = UX**, **CI = truth**.
- CI runs: format check, lint, typecheck, unit tests
- Optional: required status checks on PR

## 5) Add MCP tools to reduce “agent thrash” and make steps smaller
MCP lets Cursor connect tools/data so the agent can do smaller, verified steps (e.g., query your issue tracker, run structured checks, pull exact context) instead of guessing. citeturn0search2turn0search5turn0search12

This helps with your “small tasks across models” desire because you can:
- Make the agent call a tool for *facts* (tests, lint results, repo metadata)
- Use the model for *decisions* and minimal edits

## 6) Add a “patch gate” to prevent regressions from the review loop
Given the reports of review loops reverting previously accepted changes, a simple guardrail helps: your hook script can snapshot a diff hash and refuse to auto-revert or re-edit already-accepted hunks unless tests failed. citeturn0search14turn0search18

---

If you tell me your stack (TS/Node + package manager + monorepo or not) I’ll propose a concrete orchestration layout (exact commands + where to run them: Cursor Hook vs Husky vs CI) that stays fast and eliminates the “dialogue errors” problem.
