## User

Can you do a cost analysis of what it would be if we run Paramese agent on the railway 24-7 with DeepSeek flash, and it was primarily running as a freegram one per like four, like each one generated different departments, so fundraising is like primarily running comms and self-healing and hardening the comms to do regeneration and build out the whole grid, and then another one doing like go-to-market in the same game. What is like generally the cost per agent if we did that operating 24-7 on like a monthly basis? And basically then would be like always on three or four of these, and then we would either like SSH into them or something and have like one chief of staff agent that orchestrates them over like SSH or something like that. and is there a smarter way to do this?

---

## Assistant

I’ll estimate Railway compute, DeepSeek token spend, and orchestration overhead for 3–4 always-on agents plus a chief-of-staff layer, then compare SSH-style operation with safer queue/scheduler patterns.

---

## Assistant

Mr. White, I’d model this as **four always-on department agents + one orchestration/chief-of-staff agent**. Assuming “Paramese” is your internal agent runtime and “DeepSeek Flash” means **DeepSeek-V4-Flash**.

## Bottom line

A sane early setup is probably:

| Setup | Cost per department agent / month | 4 department agents | Chief-of-staff agent | Likely total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Mostly event-driven / light polling | **$15–$30** | $60–$120 | $20–$50 | **$80–$170/mo** |
| Practical always-on ops agents | **$35–$60** | $140–$240 | $30–$80 | **$170–$320/mo** |
| Active agent loop every minute | **$100–$130** | $400–$520 | $50–$150 | **$450–$670/mo** |
| Bad design: aggressive loops / huge context | **$500–$6,000+** | $2k–$24k+ | variable | **avoid** |

My default recommendation: **budget $200–$400/month** for a 4-agent Paramese grid on Railway using DeepSeek-V4-Flash, assuming disciplined prompting, event-driven runs, modest memory, and logs/state storage.

## Current pricing inputs

Railway charges by resource usage. Their current docs list **RAM at $10/GB/month**, **CPU at $20/vCPU/month**, **egress at $0.05/GB**, and **volume storage at $0.15/GB/month**. Hobby includes $5 of monthly usage; Pro includes $20 of monthly usage, so the bill is effectively the greater of the plan minimum or actual resource usage. citeturn827947view1

DeepSeek-V4-Flash currently shows: **$0.14 per 1M cache-miss input tokens**, **$0.0028 per 1M cache-hit input tokens**, and **$0.28 per 1M output tokens**. DeepSeek also says `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` map to DeepSeek-V4-Flash modes for compatibility. citeturn827947view2

## Per-agent cost model

For one Railway-hosted agent:

```text
Monthly agent cost =
  Railway compute
+ DeepSeek token usage
+ small storage/logging/network overhead
```

Railway compute roughs out like this:

| Agent container size | Railway resource cost / month |
|---|---:|
| 0.25 vCPU avg + 0.5 GB RAM | ~$10 |
| 0.5 vCPU avg + 1 GB RAM | ~$20 |
| 1 vCPU avg + 1 GB RAM | ~$30 |
| 1 vCPU avg + 2 GB RAM | ~$40 |

For a normal Python/Node agent that mostly waits, calls tools, then asks DeepSeek, assume **$10–$30/month per container** on Railway.

The token side depends on how often each agent thinks. Using DeepSeek-V4-Flash cache-miss pricing:

| Agent behavior | Assumed cadence | Tokens per run | DeepSeek cost / month |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Light heartbeat | Every 10 min | 5k in / 1k out | **~$4.23** |
| Practical periodic worker | Every 5 min | 10k in / 2k out | **~$16.93** |
| Active operator | Every 1 min | 10k in / 2k out | **~$84.67** |
| Aggressive loop | Every 10 sec | 10k in / 2k out | **~$508.03** |
| Context-bloat failure mode | Every 1 min | 1M in / 10k out | **~$6,169** |

So the **normal practical per-agent number** is:

```text
$20 Railway compute
+ ~$17 DeepSeek
+ ~$5 storage/logs/db share
= ~$40–$45 per agent/month
```

For **4 department agents**, that’s about **$160–$180/month** before the chief-of-staff agent. Add an orchestrator and shared DB/logging, and I’d expect **$200–$300/month** in the realistic early version.

## The real risk: context bloat

DeepSeek-V4-Flash has a **1M-token context length** and high max output, which is useful, but it creates a cost trap. citeturn827947view2

One 1M-token cache-miss prompt costs:

```text
1M input tokens × $0.14 = $0.14 per call
```

That sounds cheap until you do it every minute:

```text
43,200 calls/month × $0.14 = $6,048/month
```

That is per agent, before output tokens. The grid should use **summaries, working memory, retrieved context, and cached static prompts**, instead of passing the entire department history into every run.

## Smarter architecture than SSH orchestration

Do **not** make the chief-of-staff agent SSH into workers as the primary control plane. Use SSH for debugging/admin only.

Better structure:

```text
Chief-of-staff orchestrator
        ↓
Task queue / job table
        ↓
Department workers:
  - Fundraising/comms
  - GTM
  - Engineering/self-healing
  - Ops/research
        ↓
Shared state:
  Postgres + Redis/queue + vector memory + audit log
```

Each department agent should be a **stateless worker** that pulls jobs, executes bounded steps, writes results, and exits or idles. The chief-of-staff should assign jobs through a database/queue or internal HTTP API, not shell commands.

Railway supports private service networking, so the orchestrator can talk to internal services without exposing every worker publicly. Railway describes private networking for colocated services and high-speed internal transfer. citeturn900065view0

For periodic tasks, use Railway cron jobs where possible. Railway cron services are expected to start, run a task, and exit, which saves resources between executions; the shortest interval is currently 5 minutes. citeturn900065view1

## Recommended operating model

Use **three tiers of agent execution**:

| Tier | Use case | How it runs | Cost behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| Event-driven | Email received, CRM change, deploy failed, lead added | Webhook → queue → agent | Cheapest |
| Scheduled | Daily fundraising summary, weekly GTM plan, hourly health check | Railway cron / queue | Controlled |
| Always-on | Chief-of-staff listener, urgent alert router | One small container | Predictable |

The chief-of-staff agent should stay always-on. The department agents should wake up from **events, queues, or cron**, rather than free-running forever.

## Practical first deployment

I’d start with:

1. **One orchestrator service** on Railway.
2. **One worker service** that can run different department roles from config.
3. **Postgres** for jobs, state, artifacts, approvals, and audit trail.
4. **Redis or DB-backed queue** for work dispatch.
5. **DeepSeek-V4-Flash** as the default model.
6. **Escalation model only for hard tasks**, not every loop.
7. **Hard token budgets** per job, per agent, and per day.
8. **Human approval gates** for external comms, fundraising outreach, deploy changes, and anything irreversible.

This means you may not need four separate containers at first. You can run one worker pool with four “personas” or departments. Split into separate services only when isolation, permissions, or scaling requires it.

## My estimate for your described setup

For **fundraising/comms**, **GTM**, **self-healing/hardening**, and one more department agent, plus a chief-of-staff orchestrator:

```text
Railway:
  4 department workers × ~$20 = ~$80
  chief-of-staff × ~$20 = ~$20
  shared DB/storage/logs = ~$10–$40
  Railway total = ~$110–$140

DeepSeek:
  4 department agents × ~$15–$40 = ~$60–$160
  chief-of-staff = ~$20–$80
  DeepSeek total = ~$80–$240

Total:
  ~$190–$380/month
```

I’d budget **$300/month** as the clean initial number, with a hard cap at **$500/month** until you have real usage telemetry. The dangerous version is an agent loop that “thinks” every few seconds or drags full context into every call; that can jump from hundreds to thousands per month quickly.

## User

vs buying a dedicaed box and running a local model. and waht version of a local setup could we do to get enough intelligence that it matches qualtiy

---

## Assistant

I’ll compare hosted DeepSeek, a dedicated local GPU box, and a hybrid setup across monthly cost, payback period, hardware tiers, and agent-quality tradeoffs.

---

## Assistant

The key variables are VRAM and utilization: local hardware mainly wins for heavy steady token volume, privacy, or control, while hosted DeepSeek likely wins current cost-efficiency.

---

## Assistant

Mr. White, I would **keep DeepSeek-V4-Flash hosted as the main brain** and use local hardware only as a **hybrid worker / privacy / experimentation layer**. DeepSeek-V4-Flash is priced so low that a dedicated local box rarely wins on pure cost unless you are doing very high-frequency loops or you need local control.

Representative hardware options I’d consider or avoid by tier:

products{"selections":[["turn649161product0","Apple Mac Studio M3 Ultra 96GB"],["turn915751product2","ASUS TUF RTX 5090 32GB"],["turn915751product0","MSI RTX 5090 SUPRIM Liquid 32GB"],["turn915751product3","ASUS ROG Astral RTX 5090 32GB"],["turn938391product17","PNY NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada 48GB"],["turn938391product1","PNY RTX 6000 Ada 48GB"],["turn938391product0","Dell NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada 48GB"],["turn557913product15","Gigabyte RTX 3090 Turbo 24GB Used"]],"tags":["Quiet Mac box","Best single GPU","Fast liquid card","Premium 5090","48GB pro VRAM","Pro VRAM option","Enterprise GPU","Cheap used VRAM"]}

## Cost comparison

| Option | Upfront | Monthly running cost | Quality level | Verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| **Railway + DeepSeek-V4-Flash** | $0 hardware | **~$200–$600/mo** depending on loop frequency | Actual DeepSeek-V4-Flash | Best baseline |
| **1× RTX 5090 local box** | ~$5k–$7k | ~$40–$125 power, plus amortization | Good 35B-class local agents | Good dev box, weaker than DeepSeek Flash |
| **Mac Studio M3 Ultra 256GB** | ~$6k–$8k | Low power, likely ~$20–$70/mo | Can load larger models, slower | Easiest big-memory local box |
| **2× RTX 5090 box** | ~$10k–$14k | ~$100–$220 power | 70B–122B-class possible | Strong hybrid box |
| **4× RTX 5090 box** | ~$20k–$25k | ~$250–$500 power/heat | Near DeepSeek Flash if configured well | Expensive and operationally annoying |
| **4× RTX 6000 Ada / L40S server** | ~$28k–$40k+ | ~$200–$400 power, plus cooling | Best local quality tier | Quality play, cost-inefficient |

DeepSeek-V4-Flash currently costs **$0.14 per 1M cache-miss input tokens**, **$0.0028 per 1M cache-hit input tokens**, and **$0.28 per 1M output tokens**. It also supports **1M context**, JSON output, and tool calls. citeturn439681view0

A 10k-input / 2k-output call costs roughly:

```text
10k input tokens × $0.14 / 1M = $0.0014
2k output tokens × $0.28 / 1M = $0.00056

Total = ~$0.00196 per call
```

So if one agent thinks once per minute all month:

```text
43,200 calls/month × $0.00196 = ~$84.67/month
```

For five agents, that is about **$423/month in model cost** before Railway. If the agents think every five minutes, it is closer to **$85/month total for five agents**. That is why local hardware has a hard time beating hosted DeepSeek on cost.

## The quality-matching problem

DeepSeek-V4-Flash is a **284B total / 13B active parameter MoE model** with **1M context**. DeepSeek’s own release says Flash is the fast, economical model and that its reasoning approaches V4-Pro on simpler agent tasks. citeturn918664view0

The open-weight DeepSeek-V4-Flash model card lists **284B total / 13B active parameters**, **1M context**, and mixed **FP4 + FP8** precision for the instruct model. It also recommends at least **384K context** for Think Max reasoning mode. citeturn918664view1

That means a truly comparable local setup is not “one gaming PC.” It is more like:

```text
Minimum serious local match:
  4× 48GB GPUs
  or 256GB unified-memory Mac
  or 4× RTX 5090 with compromises/offload

Practical local compromise:
  1× RTX 5090
  Qwen3.5-35B-A3B or similar
  cloud escalation to DeepSeek for hard tasks
```

## Best local model choices

### 1. Practical single-box agent: Qwen3.5-35B-A3B

This is the setup I would actually start with locally.

Qwen3.5-35B-A3B is a **35B total / 3B active** MoE model with **262,144 native context**, extensible up to about **1,010,000 tokens**. The model card says it supports vLLM, SGLang, KTransformers, and other deployment stacks. citeturn794651view0

Use this for:

| Department agent | Suitability |
|---|---|
| GTM | Strong enough |
| Fundraising research | Strong enough with retrieval |
| Draft comms | Strong enough with review |
| Self-healing / infra triage | Good for diagnosis, keep approval gates |
| Chief-of-staff orchestration | Good if it routes hard tasks upward |

This does **not fully match DeepSeek-V4-Flash**, but it may be “smart enough” if the agent is tool-heavy, retrieval-heavy, and constrained by policies.

Recommended hardware:

```text
1× RTX 5090 32GB
128GB–256GB system RAM
2–4TB NVMe
Ubuntu
vLLM or SGLang
LiteLLM router
Postgres + Redis/NATS/Temporal
```

The RTX 5090 has **32GB GDDR7**, 5th-generation Tensor Cores, and **575W total graphics power** according to NVIDIA’s specs. citeturn860026view1

### 2. Higher-quality local compromise: Qwen3.5-122B-A10B

This is the level I would use if you want a serious local agent brain.

Qwen3.5-122B-A10B is a **122B total / 10B active** MoE model with **262,144 native context**, extensible to about **1,010,000 tokens**. The model card reports strong agent/coding scores, including **SWE-bench Verified 72.0**, **Terminal Bench 2.0 49.4**, and **BFCL-V4 72.2** in its benchmark table. citeturn181462view0

Recommended hardware:

```text
2× RTX 6000 Ada 48GB
or 4× RTX 5090 32GB
or Mac Studio M3 Ultra 256GB for slower, quieter inference
```

This is the first tier where “local model quality” starts to feel serious for a multi-agent company OS.

### 3. Actual DeepSeek-V4-Flash locally

This is the closest quality match because it is the same family.

Recommended hardware:

```text
Best practical:
  4× RTX 6000 Ada 48GB
  192GB VRAM total

Possible but annoying:
  4× RTX 5090 32GB
  128GB VRAM total
  likely offload / quantization / context compromises

Quiet but slower:
  Mac Studio M3 Ultra 256GB
```

RTX 6000 Ada gives you **48GB ECC GDDR6** per card and **300W max power**. NVIDIA’s L40S is also **48GB ECC GDDR6**, with **864GB/s bandwidth** and **350W max power**. citeturn736513view4 citeturn736513view3

The Mac Studio M3 Ultra can be configured with **256GB unified memory** and has **819GB/s memory bandwidth**, which makes it attractive for large local models, though NVIDIA GPUs are generally better for high-throughput serving. citeturn715914view4

## Power cost reality in Los Angeles

Los Angeles residential electricity is currently around **$0.23/kWh** according to EnergySage’s May 2026 LA data. citeturn736513view1

Approximate 24/7 electricity cost at that rate:

| Average draw | Monthly power cost |
|---:|---:|
| 250W | ~$41/mo |
| 500W | ~$83/mo |
| 750W | ~$124/mo |
| 1,200W | ~$199/mo |
| 2,500W | ~$414/mo |

A 4× GPU box can become a heat/noise/power problem quickly. In Los Angeles, the cooling load matters too.

## Break-even

Against a **$300/month hosted DeepSeek/Railway setup**, a **$6,000 local box** with **$80/month power** breaks even only if it fully replaces the hosted stack:

```text
$6,000 / ($300 - $80) = ~27 months
```

But a single $6k box will not fully match DeepSeek-V4-Flash quality. The quality-matching box is closer to **$20k–$40k**, and that does not beat hosted DeepSeek unless your API bill rises into the **$1,500–$3,000/month** range.

## Smarter setup

The best architecture is hybrid:

```text
Chief-of-staff orchestrator
        ↓
LiteLLM / model router
        ↓
Local model:
  Qwen3.5-35B-A3B or Qwen3.5-122B-A10B
        ↓
Cloud escalation:
  DeepSeek-V4-Flash
  DeepSeek-V4-Pro for hard tasks
        ↓
Workers:
  fundraising
  GTM
  comms
  infra/self-healing
        ↓
State:
  Postgres + vector store + job queue + audit log
```

Use the local model for:

```text
summaries
routine planning
retrieval over internal docs
drafts
classification
monitoring
low-risk tool calls
```

Use hosted DeepSeek for:

```text
long-horizon reasoning
complex code changes
fundraising strategy
important outbound comms
multi-step tool workflows
anything with high downside
```

Do **not** orchestrate through SSH as the normal interface. Use an internal API or queue. SSH should be for admin/debugging only.

## My recommendation

Start with this:

```text
Hosted:
  DeepSeek-V4-Flash for main agent reasoning
  Railway for orchestrator/workers

Local:
  1× RTX 5090 dev box
  Qwen3.5-35B-A3B
  local embeddings + memory + document parsing
  cloud fallback for hard tasks
```

Budget:

```text
Hosted agents:     ~$250–$500/mo
Local box power:   ~$40–$125/mo
Hardware upfront:  ~$5k–$7k
```

Upgrade path:

```text
Phase 1:
  1× RTX 5090 + Qwen3.5-35B-A3B

Phase 2:
  2× RTX 5090 or 2× RTX 6000 Ada
  Qwen3.5-122B-A10B

Phase 3:
  4× RTX 6000 Ada / L40S
  DeepSeek-V4-Flash local
```

The clean answer: **buying a dedicated box makes sense for control, privacy, experimentation, and reducing dumb high-volume calls. It does not make sense as a pure cost replacement for DeepSeek-V4-Flash yet.**

## User

How do we get an openclaw or Hermes agent that feels as fast as chat got

---

## Assistant

I’ll frame this around perceived latency: fast first token, smooth streaming, minimal tool stalls, and background work hidden behind the UI.

---

## Assistant

Mr. White, the way to make an OpenClaw/Hermes agent feel as fast as ChatGPT is to optimize for **time-to-first-useful-output**, not full task completion time.

Use this architecture:

```text
User message
  ↓
Fast local/router model: instant read + short response
  ↓
Async worker queue
  ↓
Hermes/OpenClaw agent tools + browser + shell + memory
  ↓
Bigger model only when needed
  ↓
Stream progress back continuously
```

## Best answer: use Hermes Agent + a fast OpenAI-compatible model endpoint

I would use **Hermes Agent** as the agent shell. It already supports persistent memory, scheduled automations, subagents, terminal backends, streaming tool output, and custom model endpoints. Its README says it can use “your own endpoint” and switch models with `hermes model`, and it supports isolated subagents for parallel workstreams. citeturn247583view2

OpenClaw is also viable, especially for a personal assistant that runs across WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Signal, iMessage, and other channels. Its repo describes it as a local-first personal assistant, with local models and multi-agent routing support. citeturn481651view1

For your use case, I’d bias toward **Hermes Agent** for the company-ops agent and use OpenClaw only when you specifically want chat-app-native personal assistant behavior.

## The speed stack I’d build

### Local model server

Use **SGLang** first, **vLLM** second.

SGLang is designed for low-latency serving with RadixAttention, prefix caching, and multi-GPU parallelism. citeturn733843view1 It also supports speculative decoding, including n-gram speculation and draft-model speculation. citeturn733843view2

vLLM is the compatibility fallback. It gives you an OpenAI-compatible server, which makes it easy to plug into Hermes, OpenClaw, LiteLLM, and standard OpenAI SDK clients. citeturn733843view4

### Model choice

For local speed, use one of these:

| Model | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** | Best fast local agent brain | 35B total, 3B active, 262K native context, strong agent/coding benchmark scores |
| **Hermes 4.3 36B** | Best Hermes-family local model | Built for consumer local inference / enterprise self-deployment |
| **DeepSeek-V4-Flash API** | Best hosted speed/quality fallback | Strong quality, huge context, cheap enough to use as escalation |
| **Hermes 4 70B** | Higher quality local, slower | Better on larger box, overkill for every turn |

Qwen3.6-35B-A3B is especially attractive because it is a **35B total / 3B activated** model with **262,144 native context**, extensible up to **1,010,000 tokens**, and the model card highlights agentic coding improvements and OpenAI-compatible serving through SGLang/vLLM. citeturn247583view0

Hermes 4.3 36B is a good fit when you specifically want the Hermes model family. Nous says Hermes 4.3 was trained with context up to **512K**, nearly matches Hermes 4 70B at about half the parameter cost, and is shaped for consumer local inference or enterprise self-deployment. citeturn680268view3

## Concrete setup

### 1. Run the model server

For Qwen3.6 with SGLang:

```bash
docker run --gpus all \
  --shm-size 32g \
  -p 30000:30000 \
  -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
  --ipc=host \
  lmsysorg/sglang:latest \
  python3 -m sglang.launch_server \
    --model-path Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 30000
```

The Qwen model card gives this general SGLang serving pattern and shows that it exposes an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. citeturn247583view0

For a Hermes 4.3 local endpoint, use the same pattern with the Hermes model path:

```bash
python3 -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model-path NousResearch/Hermes-4.3-36B \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 30000 \
  --context-length 32768 \
  --mem-fraction-static 0.85 \
  --log-level warning
```

Start with **32K context**, then increase only after measuring latency. Giant context kills the ChatGPT-like feel.

### 2. Put LiteLLM in front

Use a router so Hermes/OpenClaw can call different models without code changes:

```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: local-fast
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
      api_base: http://localhost:30000/v1
      api_key: EMPTY

  - model_name: local-hermes
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/NousResearch/Hermes-4.3-36B
      api_base: http://localhost:30000/v1
      api_key: EMPTY

  - model_name: deepseek-flash
    litellm_params:
      model: deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash
      api_key: ${DEEPSEEK_API_KEY}
```

Then route by task:

```text
simple chat / status / routing      → local-fast
company memory / personality        → local-hermes
hard strategy / complex code        → DeepSeek-V4-Flash
high-stakes finalization            → DeepSeek-V4-Pro or GPT-class model
```

### 3. Make the UI stream immediately

ChatGPT feels fast largely because it streams. OpenAI’s own docs explain that streaming lets the client start printing the beginning of the output while the model continues generating the rest. citeturn680268view0

Your agent should do this:

```text
0–100ms: show “reading…”
300–700ms: stream first sentence
1–3s: stream answer or plan
3s+: continue background task with progress events
```

For example:

```text
User: “Audit yesterday’s GTM progress and prep a fundraising update.”

Agent immediately:
“I’ll check the GTM log, recent CRM changes, and fundraising notes, then produce a founder-ready update.”

Then streams:
- checking CRM
- reading notes
- summarizing deltas
- drafting update
- waiting for approval
```

The user should never wait silently for the whole tool chain.

## The key design rule

Use a **fast front agent** and **slow background workers**.

```text
Front agent:
  - reads user intent
  - gives immediate response
  - decides route
  - keeps output short
  - streams progress

Worker agents:
  - browser
  - shell
  - code
  - email/calendar/CRM
  - long research
  - report generation
```

This gives you the ChatGPT feel while still letting the agent run real tasks.

## Latency rules

Use these hard limits:

| Component | Target |
|---|---:|
| UI acknowledgement | <100ms |
| Time to first token | <700ms |
| First useful sentence | <1.5s |
| Normal chat answer | <5s |
| Tool progress update | every 2–5s |
| Background job acceptance | <1s |
| Background task completion | async |

The model does not need to finish the task quickly. The agent needs to **respond, stream, and show progress** quickly.

## Prompt/cache strategy

Keep the static system prompt identical across calls. Put dynamic user/task info at the end.

OpenAI’s prompt caching docs say repeated prompt prefixes can reduce latency by up to **80%** and input token costs by up to **90%**, and they specifically recommend putting static instructions/examples at the beginning and variable content later. citeturn680268view1

Use this shape:

```text
STATIC PREFIX:
  - company operating principles
  - agent role
  - tool rules
  - output format
  - safety/approval rules

DYNAMIC TAIL:
  - current user request
  - retrieved memory
  - relevant artifacts
  - active task state
```

Avoid loading the full memory every turn. Retrieve only the top relevant facts.

## Output-token discipline

The fastest response is the one that generates fewer tokens. OpenAI’s latency guide says generating tokens is usually the highest-latency step, and cutting output tokens by 50% may cut latency by roughly 50%. citeturn680268view2

Default every agent response to:

```text
- 1 sentence acknowledgement
- short plan
- streamed progress
- final concise result
```

Then let the user ask for expansion.

## What I’d deploy for you

### Fast version

```text
Hardware:
  1× RTX 5090 or rented equivalent GPU
  128GB RAM
  2–4TB NVMe

Runtime:
  Hermes Agent
  SGLang
  LiteLLM
  Postgres
  Redis/NATS queue

Models:
  Qwen3.6-35B-A3B as default fast brain
  Hermes 4.3 36B for personality/memory-heavy work
  DeepSeek-V4-Flash for escalation
```

### Better company-agent version

```text
Chief-of-staff agent:
  DeepSeek-V4-Flash or Qwen3.6-35B-A3B

Department workers:
  Hermes Agent subagents

Fast local model:
  Qwen3.6-35B-A3B

Hermes model:
  Hermes 4.3 36B

Escalation:
  DeepSeek-V4-Flash / Pro
```

## My recommendation

Build it as:

```text
Hermes Agent
  + SGLang
  + Qwen3.6-35B-A3B for speed
  + Hermes 4.3 36B for Hermes-native behavior
  + DeepSeek-V4-Flash fallback
  + streaming UI
  + async workers
```

OpenClaw/Hermes will feel fast once the user-facing loop is **streaming, short, cached, and asynchronous**. A single local 70B model trying to do every step inline will feel slower than ChatGPT even on good hardware.
