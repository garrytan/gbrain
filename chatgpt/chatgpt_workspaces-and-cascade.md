Here’s a breakdown of how to use **entity["software", "Windsurf", 0]** workspaces together with its **“entity["software", "Cascade", 0]”** feature, Mr. White — how they relate and how to set things up.  

---

### What they are  
- Windsurf is an AI-augmented IDE built on top of VS Code. citeturn0search7turn0search8turn0search4turn0search2  
- Cascade is the built-in AI-agent (within Windsurf) which really drives large-scale automation: multi-file edits, workflows, context awareness, rules/memories, etc. citeturn0search4turn0search9turn0search2  
- A “workspace” in this context refers to the folder/project you open in Windsurf — your codebase plus settings (including .windsurf config, rules, workflows) tied to that project.

---

### How workspaces + Cascade work together  
1. When you open a workspace in Windsurf, Cascade understands the project context: files, structure, etc. citeturn0search4turn0search3  
2. You can define **Rules**, **Memories**, **Workflows** in the workspace (e.g., under `.windsurf/` directory) that guide Cascade’s behavior for *that* workspace. citeturn0search4turn0search9  
3. You can ask Cascade to operate in two primary modes:  
   - *Code mode*: Generate or modify code in your workspace automatically. citeturn0search4  
   - *Chat mode*: Ask questions, get explanations, context-aware suggestions. citeturn0search7turn0search4  
4. Workflows allow you to automate repetitive sequences of steps within the workspace (e.g., run tests + push + deploy). These are saved under the workspace and invoked via commands. citeturn0search9  
5. The workspace also encompasses version control integration (e.g., with Git), so you can commit, push, branch inside Windsurf + Cascade. For example, editing via `workspaces/my-repo-name`. citeturn0search3

### Quick setup guide  
Here’s a minimal flow to get a repository running in Windsurf with Cascade:  
- Clone or open your project folder in Windsurf (this becomes your workspace).  
- Ensure Git is installed and repository is initialized (if needed).  
- In the workspace, create a `.windsurf/` directory if not already there. Inside you may add files like `workflows/`, `rules.md`, etc.  
- Open Cascade (in Windsurf: `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+L or click the Cascade icon) to interact. citeturn0search4  
- Use Cascade to, for example, generate boilerplate code, apply edits, ask for refactors.  
- Create and invoke workflows via `/workflow-name` command to automate tasks. citeturn0search9  
- Version control your code: create branches, commit changes, push to remote — Windsurf supports Git workflows.  

---

### Best practices  
- Keep your workspace structure clean: separate features, modules, folders logically so Cascade has clear context.  
- Define workspace-specific rules so Cascade learns your coding style/patterns.  
- Use Workflows for repeated tasks (e.g., “run lint→test→commit”).  
- Regularly commit meaningful snapshots to Git so you can revert if AI edits go astray.  
- Use Cascade’s “Explain & Fix” mode when you get errors: highlight the error in your code and ask Cascade to explain/fix. citeturn0search4

If you like, I can pull together **specific commands** and **folder/config examples** tailored for a Git project in Windsurf (including sample `.windsurf/rules.md`, `.windsurf/workflows/ci.md`, etc.). Would you like me to do that?
