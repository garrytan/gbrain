Here’s a concise overview of **Vercel AI testing** and related tooling:

**What “Vercel AI” is**  
Vercel is a cloud platform focused on building and deploying web applications **and now AI-enabled apps**. It offers an open-source AI SDK that helps developers integrate large language models (LLMs) and AI features like chat UIs, text streaming, tool calling, and multi-step agents into apps using frameworks like **Next.js, React, Vue, Svelte, etc.** citeturn0search1turn0search2

**Testing AI behavior (Evals)**  
Vercel supports **evaluations (“evals”)**, which are specialized tests for how an AI model performs on specific tasks. These are like automated checks or integration tests designed for the unpredictability of LLMs. Instead of traditional assertions, evals measure whether the model outputs meet defined qualitative or quantitative criteria. citeturn0search0

**Dev tooling for AI testing**  
Developers can write tests using the Vercel AI SDK (often with tools like **Vitest**) to:  
- Call different models deterministically  
- Capture responses, intermediate steps, and metadata  
- Compare outputs against expected behavior  
This lets you validate a model’s behavior after prompt tweaks, model swaps, or logic changes. citeturn0search5

**Testing without real model calls**  
The AI SDK includes **mock providers and helpers** to simulate model behavior for unit tests, so you don’t have to hit real APIs during CI or fast runs. citeturn0search30

**Platform integrations & tooling**  
Vercel’s ecosystem also includes AI integrations (e.g., Autonoma AI for end-to-end testing), observability tools, and marketplace skills that help automate testing and quality workflows in AI apps. citeturn0search11

**Bottom line:**  
“AI testing” on the Vercel platform refers to practices and tooling around **evaluating, validating, and automating checks for AI-powered application behavior**, especially where traditional software testing isn’t sufficient due to model variability. citeturn0search0
