**Fastly** is an American cloud infrastructure company best known for its **edge cloud platform** and **content delivery network (CDN)** services. It helps websites and apps load faster, stay secure, and scale globally. citeturn0search1

**Key points:**

- **What it does:** Fastly operates a globally distributed network that caches and delivers web content (images, pages, video, APIs) from servers closest to end-users to reduce latency and speed up load times. citeturn0search1turn0search0  
- **Edge cloud platform:** Beyond basic CDN, Fastly offers **edge computing**, **security services** (DDoS protection, web application firewall), **load balancing**, **image optimization**, and real-time analytics. citeturn0search1turn0search11  
- **Real-time control:** One of its differentiators is highly configurable caching and instant purging/updates across its network, useful for dynamic content. citeturn0search24  
- **History:** Founded in 2011 in San Francisco by Artur Bergman and publicly traded since 2019. citeturn0search1

In simple terms: Fastly helps deliver digital content faster and more securely to users around the world by using a **distributed network of edge servers**. citeturn0search14

**xTerraform** (often written **XTerraform**) is a **wrapper and orchestration layer around Terraform** designed to manage **large, multi-account / multi-environment infrastructure** more safely and repeatably.

**What it’s for**
- Operating Terraform at **scale** (many stacks, regions, accounts)
- Enforcing **structure, conventions, and guardrails**
- Reducing copy-paste and configuration drift

**Core ideas**
- **Stack-based architecture**: You define reusable “stacks” (Terraform modules + config) and deploy them consistently across environments.
- **Separation of concerns**:  
  - Terraform = resource definitions  
  - xTerraform = orchestration, environment wiring, execution order
- **Opinionated layout**: Enforces repo structure so teams don’t freestyle themselves into chaos.
- **Safer execution**: Helps control apply order, dependencies, and blast radius.

**How it compares**
- vs **raw Terraform**: Adds discipline and orchestration Terraform intentionally avoids.
- vs **Terragrunt**: Similar goal, but xTerraform tends to be **more opinionated** and focused on **enterprise-scale patterns**.
- vs **Pulumi**: Still Terraform under the hood; no language switch.

**When it makes sense**
- Many AWS/GCP accounts or subscriptions  
- Multiple environments (dev/stage/prod)  
- Teams >3–4 engineers touching infra  
- Strong need for consistency and repeatability

**When it’s overkill**
- Single account
- Small startup infra
- One or two Terraform modules total

If you want, I can:
- Compare **xTerraform vs Terragrunt** directly  
- Show a **sample repo structure**  
- Explain whether it’s a good fit for *your* infra size and team
