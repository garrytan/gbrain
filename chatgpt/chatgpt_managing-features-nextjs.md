Managing features in **Next.js** usually refers to controlling how and when parts of your app are enabled or rolled out to users. The most common pattern for this is **feature flags** (a.k.a. *feature toggles*) — they let you turn code paths on/off without redeploying.citeturn0search35

## 1) Feature Flags (the Core Pattern)
Feature flags are conditional switches you wrap around new functionality so you can control exposure.

### Basic approaches
**Environment variables:**  
Define simple flags in your `.env` files like:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEW_UI=true
```

Then conditionally render:

```tsx
{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NEW_UI === "true" && <NewUI />}
```

Easy and zero-deps, but you must redeploy to change the flag.citeturn0search26

**Custom flag functions / config file:**  
You can centralize flag definitions instead of sprinkling env checks, e.g.:

```ts
export const flags = {
  showBanner: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_BANNER === "true",
};
```

Then use: `{flags.showBanner && <Banner />}`.

## 2) Dedicated Feature Flag SDKs
For dynamic control — especially in production — use a feature flag service or SDK:

**Vercel “Flags SDK”**  
Next.js can use Vercel’s Flags SDK to define flags as functions and evaluate them on the server. You write flag definitions and decide logic once, then call them where needed. Evaluation happens server-side for consistency and avoids layout flicker. Flags can be overridden via Vercel’s toolbar for testing.citeturn0search0turn0search19

**Unleash / Statsig / ConfigCat, etc.**  
Providers like Unleash or Statsig give you dashboards, targeting rules, percentage rollouts, A/B testing, and remote control without deployments. You install their Next.js SDK, wrap your app (e.g., with a provider), and use their hooks or functions to read flag values.citeturn0search5turn0search4

Example with Unleash:

```tsx
import { FlagProvider, useFlag } from '@unleash/nextjs';

function App() {
  const showFeature = useFlag('new-feature');
  return showFeature ? <NewFeature /> : <Fallback />;
}
```

## 3) Best Practices for Managing Flags
- **Name clearly** (e.g., `newCheckoutV2`). Avoid ambiguous names.citeturn0search3  
- **Limit lifespan** — remove flags once full rollout is complete to avoid technical debt.citeturn0search3  
- **Test thoroughly** — include flag states in automated tests (on/off).citeturn0search4  
- **Server evaluation** — prefer server-side evaluation in Next.js (App Router) to avoid client layout shifts.citeturn0search0  
- **Use progressive rollout** — target specific user segments or percentages for safer production deployments.citeturn0search1

## 4) Organizing Feature Management in Next.js
- **Central flags module** — keep flag definitions and access logic in one place.  
- **Abstract consumers** — don’t litter flag conditionals everywhere; wrap in components/hooks.  
- **Separation of concerns** — UI logic remains separate from flag logic.  
- **Environment vs service flags** — env flags for simple cases; service flags for dynamic control.

---

In summary: mix **env-based toggles** for simple static feature switches with **SDK-based feature flags** (Vercel Flags SDK, Unleash, etc.) for controlled rollouts, safe A/B tests, and remotely managed feature visibility. Test and prune flags regularly to keep the codebase clean.citeturn0search0turn0search5
