## User

should kill email auth and go google/apple only? seems like lots of ai startups are moving towards this

I’ll frame this as a Jovie product-auth decision, checking Apple/Google constraints and current auth patterns, then weigh conversion, security, support, recovery, and platform risk.

Mr. White, I would **not kill email auth entirely yet**.

I’d do this:

**Default path:** Google + Apple  
**Fallback path:** email magic link / OTP, visually de-emphasized  
**Future path:** passkeys + workspace SSO for serious B2B/label customers

For Jovie specifically, this is the right trade. Your site positions Jovie as an AI workspace for artists/teams to plan releases, create assets, pitch playlists, and promote drops, with customers including artists and music companies/labels. That means many users will have Google or Apple accounts, while managers, labels, agencies, and enterprise buyers may still expect work email, Microsoft, Okta, or SAML/OIDC later. citeturn519303view0turn934059search1turn934059search2

**My recommendation:** make Google and Apple the obvious buttons, remove password auth, and keep email magic link as a low-prominence escape hatch.

The case for Google/Apple is strong: Google says Sign in with Google uses OAuth 2.0/OIDC, reduces separate credential creation, supports one-tap onboarding, and can reduce password/reset friction. citeturn673939view4 Apple also matters if you ship iOS: apps using third-party/social login must offer an equivalent privacy-preserving login option with limited data collection and private-email support, which is exactly the Sign in with Apple lane. citeturn954496view0

The reason to keep email fallback: **identity-provider lockout, Apple private relay weirdness, shared/team workflows, invited users, and non-Google business accounts.** Killing email entirely saves support in one area and creates support in another: “I signed up with the wrong Google account,” “my manager invited my work email,” “Apple gave you a private relay email,” “my label uses Microsoft,” etc.

Best version of the flow:

```text
Continue with Google
Continue with Apple

Use email instead
```

Then after login:

```text
Secure your account
Add another sign-in method: Google / Apple / email / passkey
```

For existing users, do **not** hard-cut email. Let them keep signing in, then prompt them to connect Google or Apple. After 30–60 days of data, you can hide email more aggressively for new users if it underperforms.

Implementation details that matter:

Use provider `sub` IDs as the durable identity key, not email. Emails can change, Apple private relay can obscure identity, and users may use the same email across providers. Use OIDC/OAuth correctly with PKCE, state, nonce, issuer/audience validation, and exact redirect URI matching; OWASP treats OAuth/OIDC as the standard foundation for federated login and documents specific security controls around these flows. citeturn673939view3

Also consider passkeys soon. Google’s passkey docs describe them as passwordless credentials tied to an account and app/site, unlocked with device biometrics/PIN, designed to replace legacy passwords. citeturn673939view5 For Jovie, passkeys are probably a better long-term “email auth replacement” than forcing everyone into Google/Apple only.

Decision rule:

| User segment | Auth approach |
|---|---|
| New consumer/artist users | Google + Apple primary |
| Existing users | Keep current email path, prompt account linking |
| Invited teammates | Email fallback required |
| Labels/agencies | Add Microsoft/Google Workspace SSO later |
| iOS app | Apple must be offered if Google/social login is offered |
| High-value workspaces | SAML/OIDC later, likely via WorkOS/Clerk/Auth0/Stytch/Supabase Auth |

So: **yes, move toward Google/Apple-first. No, don’t go Google/Apple-only yet.** Kill passwords. Keep email magic link as a quiet fallback. Measure it. Then remove it only if the data says email fallback is adding more abuse/support cost than recovered signups.
