Mr. White, **there’s no official “RAM requirement” for end-to-end (E2E) tests**, but there are real-world practical baselines you should consider, because E2E testing is resource-intensive compared with unit or integration tests. citeturn0search1turn0search11

### 🧠 Why RAM Matters for E2E Tests
- E2E tests spin up full pieces of your stack (UI browsers, backend services, databases, etc.), so they naturally consume more memory than lighter tests. citeturn0search11
- Browser-driven E2E tools (e.g., Playwright, Cypress, Selenium) launch actual browser processes — each can grab hundreds of megabytes of RAM. citeturn0search12

### 📊 Practical RAM Baselines

**Local Development Machines**
- **16 GB RAM** is a commonly recommended minimum if you’re writing and running E2E tests *locally* alongside your development environment (e.g., running Chrome + test runners + editor + build tools). citeturn0search1  
  - Less than this and you’ll often see swapping, slow test runs, or out-of-memory errors.

**CI / Dedicated Test Machines**
- For CI agents running **multiple E2E workers in parallel**, you may want **32 GB or more**, especially if you’re:
  - Running multiple browsers concurrently.
  - Spawning backend containers + databases for each test suite. citeturn0search11

### 🧪 Typical Usage Patterns
- A single Chromium process for a simple functional test can use **~200 MB+ RAM** on its own. citeturn0search12
- Large test suites with many browsers or workers will multiply this — e.g., 5 concurrent workers can easily need several GB at once.

### ⚙️ Optimization Tips (RAM-Sensitive)
- Run tests **in parallel** on dedicated agents to spread memory load. citeturn0search5
- Use **headless browser mode** in CI to reduce overhead.
- Split big suites so you don’t overload a single machine’s RAM.  
- Consider lightweight test stages (API-only E2E) where possible to reduce browser footprint.

**Bottom line:** If you want smooth local E2E runs, shoot for **≥16 GB RAM**. For CI with parallel execution and heavier stacks, **32 GB+** is a sensible target. E2E testing doesn’t have fixed system specs, but your hardware needs grow with test suite size and concurrency. citeturn0search1turn0search11
