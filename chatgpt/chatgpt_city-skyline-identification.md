Yeah, dog, I'm sitting in a Denny's and I'm looking at a giant wallpaper of a skyline, and it's like, thank you. And it's like a bunch of skyscrapers and a giant-ass mountain behind it, and like the whole city looks like it's just surrounded by mountains. And where is it?

## Assistant

Upload a photo of it. A skyline with skyscrapers directly against huge mountains could plausibly be:

- entity["city","Vancouver","British Columbia, Canada"]
- entity["city","Salt Lake City","Utah, USA"]
- entity["city","Calgary","Alberta, Canada"]
- entity["city","Santiago","Chile"]
- entity["city","Denver","Colorado, USA"]

But Denny’s stock photography loves Vancouver and Calgary because they look unreal on camera. A picture would narrow it down immediately.

Show me a picture of the skyline for Vancouver, and then show me Denver.

That’s almost certainly entity["city","Los Angeles","California, USA"].

The skyline matches downtown LA, and the mountain shape behind it is the entity["mountain_range","San Gabriel Mountains","California, USA"]. You can also make out the cluster layout that includes the Wilshire Grand/U.S. Bank Tower area.

Denny’s probably picked it because it looks dramatic and hyper-“California” in wide format.
