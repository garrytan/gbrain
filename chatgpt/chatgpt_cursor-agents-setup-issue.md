cursor agents setup failing

## Assistant

Mr. White — if your **Cursor agents setup is failing** (getting errors like *“Failed to create agents”* or setup errors), this is **not usually a local config mistake** but a known issue with Cursor’s platform itself. Here’s what’s going on and what you can (and can’t) do:

### 🔍 What the errors look like
Common symptoms reported by users:
- Trying to create a new agent instantly fails with **“Failed to create agents”** (web UI/IDE). citeturn0search1
- Agents start and then immediately disappear or error. citeturn0search4
- Background agent setup fails or errors out (secrets/env not injected). citeturn0search12
- Errors persist across browsers, platforms, networks; clearing cache or reinstalling doesn’t fix it. citeturn0search4

### 🛠 What has been tried already by users (and usually fails)
People experiencing this have tried:
- Logging out/in multiple times. citeturn0search4
- Clearing cache/cookies and switching browsers. citeturn0search4
- Reconnecting GitHub or removing/re-adding integrations. citeturn0search1
- Running local diagnostics or reinstalling Cursor. citeturn0search11

And these **do not reliably fix** the issue when it’s caused by platform instability.

### 🧠 What Cursor’s troubleshooting docs suggest
Cursor’s docs advise starting with:
1. **Network diagnostics:** *Settings → Network → Run Diagnostics* to verify connectivity to Cursor’s backend. citeturn0search8
2. Ensuring any required snapshots, environment configs, or secrets are correctly defined — but many users report setup process itself is buggy. citeturn0search12

### 📌 What’s most likely happening
Based on multiple user reports (both recent and persistent):
- This is a **server-side bug or service interruption** affecting agent creation, not just your installation. citeturn0search1
- It’s been reported across platforms, versions, and browsers, and across time spans (multiple months of reports). citeturn0search1
- In many cases Cursor team has acknowledged issues but fixes are not immediate or widely deployed. citeturn0search1

### ✅ Practical next steps
If you haven’t already:
1. **Run Cursor network diagnostics** (Settings → Network). citeturn0search8
2. **Try the desktop app version instead of web** — some reports indicate the web UI breaks while desktop sometimes works. citeturn0search4
3. **Check Cursor status or support channels** for known outages or bug fixes.
4. If you rely on agents for work, consider **temporary alternatives** until Cursor resolves this.

### 🧩 Summary
- Your setup failure is almost certainly due to **platform bugs/outages** in Cursor, not local config. citeturn0search1
- Standard fixes (cache clear, logout, reinstall) won’t reliably fix it. citeturn0search4
- Best move: run network diagnostics, try desktop version, and check support/status for updates.

If you want, tell me exactly *what error message you’re seeing* (and whether it’s the web UI or desktop IDE) and I can help debug that specific case.
