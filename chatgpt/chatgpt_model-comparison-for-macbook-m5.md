What would be the best model to run on 32GB MacBook M5 2026 model? Is it going to be the Gemma 4, or is it Quen 3.6? The Quen 3.6-35B-A3B-4bit looks good. How does that compare to other things?

I’ll verify the current model names and specs, then compare realistic 32GB Apple Silicon fit, 4-bit memory use, benchmarks, and quality/performance tradeoffs.

## Assistant

I’ve confirmed the model families exist; the next decision point is memory headroom and the local serving stack, especially for Qwen3.6-35B-A3B at 4-bit.

Mr. White, I’d pick **Qwen 3.6** over **Gemma 4** for a 32GB M5 MacBook, especially for coding, agents, and technical reasoning. The spelling is **Qwen**, not Quen.

My practical ranking for a **32GB MacBook M5**:

| Rank | Model | Best local quant | Why pick it | Main caveat |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| 1 | **Qwen3.6-27B** | Q4 / MLX 4-bit | Best quality-to-size choice; Qwen’s own benchmarks show it beating Qwen3.6-35B-A3B and Gemma4-31B on many coding/reasoning tasks | Dense model, so likely slower than the MoE 35B-A3B |
| 2 | **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** | Q4_K_S, IQ4_XS, or MLX 4-bit | Best “feels bigger than it runs” option; 35B total with only ~3B active parameters | Less memory headroom on 32GB, especially with long context |
| 3 | **Gemma 4 31B** | Q4_K_M / Q4_K_S | Strong general-purpose model, polished Google release, good multimodal/open ecosystem | Qwen appears stronger for local coding/agent work |
| 4 | **Gemma 4 26B-A4B** | Q4 | Safest fast Gemma fit on 32GB; MoE-style efficiency | Lower ceiling than Qwen3.6-27B or Gemma4-31B |

The **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit** you’re looking at is genuinely attractive. Qwen lists it as a **35B-total / 3B-activated MoE model** with 262K native context, and its official benchmark table puts it ahead of Gemma4-31B on SWE-bench Verified, Terminal-Bench, GPQA, LiveCodeBench, and AIME 2026, while tying Gemma4-31B on MMLU-Pro. citeturn681038view0

The wrinkle: **Qwen3.6-27B may be the better local flagship.** Qwen’s table shows **Qwen3.6-27B beating Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** on SWE-bench Verified, SWE-bench Pro, Terminal-Bench 2.0, SkillsBench, QwenWebBench, MMLU-Pro, GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench v6, and AIME26. citeturn561570view0 A recent Hugging Face community analysis using Artificial Analysis v4 also ranked Qwen3.6-27B Q4 above Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q4 and Gemma4-31B Q4, while noting that local Q4 scores usually trail full-precision hosted scores and long context consumes memory quickly. citeturn835409view0

For **32GB unified memory**, the fit looks like this:

| Model | 4-bit file size examples | 32GB fit |
|---|---:|---|
| **Qwen3.6-27B Q4_K_M** | ~17.53GB | Strong fit |
| **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q4_K_M** | ~21.39GB | Fits, tighter |
| **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B IQ4_XS** | ~18.81GB | Better headroom |
| **Gemma4-31B Q4_K_M** | ~19.60GB | Fits |
| **Gemma4-26B-A4B Q4** | ~16–18GB | Safest fit |

Those sizes come from GGUF repos and local-running guides: Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q4 variants land around **18.8–21.4GB**, Qwen3.6-27B Q4_K_M around **17.5GB**, and Gemma4-31B Q4_K_M around **19.6GB**. citeturn756404view3turn991076view0turn756404view4 Gemma’s own materials describe Gemma 4 as Apache-2.0, multimodal, up to 256K context, with 31B dense and 26B-A4B MoE variants; Unsloth’s local guide puts Gemma4-31B at roughly **20GB 4-bit** and Gemma4-26B-A4B at roughly **18GB 4-bit**. citeturn381689view2turn756404view1

The **32GB M5 MacBook Air-class machine** has **153GB/s memory bandwidth** and can be configured with 32GB unified memory; M5 Pro/Max machines are much faster for local inference because Apple lists **307GB/s** for M5 Pro and **614GB/s** for M5 Max. citeturn259297view0turn259297view2 Capacity decides whether the model fits; bandwidth drives how fast tokens decode.

Recommended setup:

**Use MLX when available.** Apple describes MLX as optimized for Apple silicon’s unified-memory architecture, which is exactly what you want on an M-series Mac. citeturn418424view0 For broad app compatibility, GGUF via LM Studio, Ollama, or llama.cpp is fine.

My exact recommendation:

**Start with `Qwen3.6-27B` 4-bit MLX or GGUF Q4_K_M.**  
That is the model I’d test first on a 32GB M5 because it has the best apparent quality-to-memory ratio.

Then keep **`Qwen3.6-35B-A3B` IQ4_XS or Q4_K_S** as the faster-feeling MoE alternative. It is the one I’d use when you care about responsiveness, agent loops, or longer interactive sessions.

Use **Gemma4-31B Q4** when you want the Google ecosystem, strong general reasoning, or a second opinion. Use **Gemma4-26B-A4B Q4** when speed and headroom matter more than peak quality.

Settings I’d use first:

```text
Model: Qwen3.6-27B Q4_K_M or MLX 4-bit
Context: 16K–32K
Temperature: 0.6–0.8
Top-p: 0.9–0.95
Apps closed: yes, especially browsers/IDEs
Avoid: 8-bit 31B–35B models on 32GB
```

For **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B**, I’d start with:

```text
Quant: IQ4_XS or Q4_K_S
Context: 16K first, then 32K if stable
Use case: coding assistant, agentic workflows, technical chat
```

Bottom line: **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit is a good pick, but Qwen3.6-27B 4-bit is probably the first model I’d install on a 32GB M5 MacBook.** Gemma 4 is competitive and cleaner for some general-use cases, while Qwen currently looks stronger for local coding and agent work.
