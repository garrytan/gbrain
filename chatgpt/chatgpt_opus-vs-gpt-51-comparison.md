Here’s a comparison between **entity["software", "GPT-5.1", 0]** (from entity["organization", "OpenAI", 0]) and **entity["software", "Claude Opus 4.5", 0]** (from entity["organization", "Anthropic", 0]). I’ll focus on their published capabilities, intended use-cases, and differences.  
   
---  
### GPT 5.1  
**Highlights & features**:  
- Released November 2025. citeturn0search16turn0search13turn0search4  
- Two variants: *Instant* (fast-response model) and *Thinking* (deeper reasoning) which automatically routes queries to the appropriate variant. citeturn0search4turn0search13  
- Adds personality/style presets (e.g., Professional, Friendly, Candid, Quirky, etc) for conversational tone. citeturn0search13turn0search16  
- Improved instruction-following and conversational behaviour compared to GPT-5. citeturn0search16turn0search4  
- Better latency trade-offs: quicker on simple tasks (Instant) and more careful/consistent on complex tasks (Thinking). citeturn0search2turn0search4  
- It remains a general-purpose model — for wide range of tasks including language, generation, maybe multimodal (some sources note multimodal) citeturn0search16turn0search5  

**Strengths**:  
- Good for everyday tasks: drafting, conversation, summarisation, etc.  
- Flexibility in mode and tone makes it more user-friendly.  
- Automatic routing and dual-variant approach help balance speed vs depth.  

**Limitations / Observations**:  
- While a step up from GPT-5, some sources describe earlier GPT-5 as “mixed” or underwhelming in some specialised tasks. citeturn0news18  
- As a general model, it may not yet beat the specialized frontier models in niche engineering/coding benchmarks (we’ll compare below).  
- The depth of agentic/tool-use (autonomous multi-step workflows) may still lag dedicated models.

### Claude Opus 4.5  
**Highlights & features**:  
- Released by Anthropic in Nov 2025. citeturn0search1turn0search10turn0search0  
- Marketed as their *most advanced model* in the “Opus” line: built for complex reasoning, long agentic workflows, tool-integration (agents). citeturn0search0  
- Strong performance on engineering/coding/agent benchmarks: e.g., SWE-bench Verified score of ~80.9% vs competitor numbers. citeturn0search1turn0search10  
- Improved efficiency: fewer tokens used for equivalent tasks, new “effort parameter” to control compute/latency trade-off. citeturn0search10  
- Integration with enterprise platforms (Azure/Microsoft Foundry, Google Cloud Vertex AI, Amazon Bedrock) emphasising production-ready deployment. citeturn0search6turn0search8  

**Strengths**:  
- Stronger for engineering/code tasks and agentic workflows (multi-step, tool-use, “thinking” over time).  
- Better token-efficiency and specialization for enterprise workflows.  
- Positioned for high-end use-cases: coding, data pipelines, long sequences, tool integration.  

**Limitations / Observations**:  
- Might cost more (premium model) and be oriented mainly toward enterprise rather than casual conversational use.  
- If your use-case is simple conversation or drafting, the added power may be overkill and latency/cost might matter.  
- Although excellent in its domain, for broad general-purpose use maybe less fine-tuned for “friendly conversation” than models with built-in conversational presets.

### Key Differences & Which to Pick  
| Dimension | GPT 5.1 | Claude Opus 4.5 |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Primary strength | General-purpose, conversational, quick response | Engineering/coding, agentic workflows, tool integration |
| User mode/flexibility | Instant + Thinking modes, personality presets | High-capability mode, enterprise-focus |
| Best suited for | Everyday tasks, chatbots, summarisation, flexible tone | Complex reasoning, code generation, multi-step workflows, enterprise agents |
| Cost / latency trade-off | Designed to balance speed & depth via variants | Possibly higher compute/latency (for top performance) but more efficient tokens for heavy tasks |
| Enterprise / production | Suitable, but less emphasised in marketing | Strong enterprise focus: production-scale, agentic tools, integration |
| Ease of use for casual tasks | Very good | Good but might be over-engineered for lighter tasks |

**My recommendation (Mr. White):**  
- If your main use-case is conversational, document drafting, summarisation, research, general assistant work: go with GPT 5.1.  
- If you’re doing heavy engineering, coding, building agents, involving tool-integration, pipelines or you’re enterprise-scale: Claude Opus 4.5 is likely the better fit.  

---  
### Things to watch or ask when selecting  
- **Cost structure**: heavy models cost more; check token / compute pricing.  
- **Latency**: if you need instant responses (e.g., chatbots), latency matters.  
- **Tool/agent support**: if you plan to integrate custom tools, retrieval, or long workflows, check the model’s support for agents, context window size, memory, tool-use.  
- **Tone / style control**: if user experience (tone/personalisation) matters, GPT 5.1 has more built-in style controls.  
- **Domain fit**: Some models excel in coding/math vs others in gentle conversational style—pick based on your domain.  
- **Future roadmap & ecosystem**: consider API support, cloud integrations, vendor lock-in, and model upgrade paths.

If you like, I can pull together a detailed **benchmark comparison table** (public scores, token-efficiency, context window size, tool-integration support) for both models. Would you like that, Mr. White?
