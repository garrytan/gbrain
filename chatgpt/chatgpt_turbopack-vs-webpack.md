Does TurboPack replace Webpack in Next.js, or is it a separate thing?

## Assistant

Mr. White — it’s **separate**.

**Turbopack** is a new Rust-based bundler built into Next.js. You can opt into it (great for faster **dev**), but it **does not fully replace Webpack yet**. As of Next.js 15.x:  
- **Dev with Turbopack is stable** (`next dev --turbo` / `--turbopack` in v15). citeturn0search5  
- **Builds with Turbopack are still experimental/alpha** in 15.3; Vercel says they’re targeting a **beta in Next.js 16**. Webpack remains the safe default for production builds. citeturn0search9turn0search1  
- Turbopack has its **own config** (separate from `webpack()` in `next.config.js`). citeturn0search3

If I'm using Next.js 15 and Vercel and Clerk.dev, is there any reason not to be using TurboPack?

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — you can (and should) use **Turbopack for dev** on Next.js 15; it’s stable. For **production builds on Vercel**, Turbopack in 15.4 is **beta** and passes all Next.js build integration tests, but still has a few caveats. citeturn0search2turn0search0

**Reasons you might not use it (yet) for prod:**
- **Beta status:** Vercel is inviting wider production use, but it’s still not the universal default. Expect occasional edge-case bugs. citeturn0search0  
- **Feature gaps vs Webpack config:** If your app depends on **custom Webpack loaders/plugins**, Turbopack won’t honor those; it has its own config path and built‑ins instead. citeturn0search10turn0search5  
- **Build quirks under active work:** Early build feedback notes differences in bundle size behavior and that production sourcemaps may include source unless adjusted—worth checking your settings before shipping closed‑source code. citeturn0search6  
- **Auth/middleware ecosystems:** Turbopack + HMR/middleware has had sporadic reports (e.g., Clerk + Sentry HMR issue). Most are resolved or have workarounds, but test your Clerk flows (sign‑in/out, middleware) with `--turbopack` before flipping your prod build. citeturn0search3

**Practical call:**
- **Dev:** Use `next dev --turbopack`. It’s faster and solid. citeturn0search2  
- **Prod on Vercel:** Try a preview deployment with `next build --turbopack` on a branch; validate Clerk routes/middleware and inspect sourcemap output. If clean, ship; if not, stick to Webpack for prod and keep Turbopack for dev until Next 16 promotes builds further. citeturn0search0

If you want, I’ll give you a short checklist to validate Clerk on a preview build.

Is there a Next.js CLI?

---

## Assistant

Yes — Next.js has a CLI, but it’s minimal.  

You usually access it via **`next`** in `package.json` scripts (or directly with `npx next`), and it supports commands like:  

- **`next dev`** – Start dev server  
- **`next build`** – Production build  
- **`next start`** – Run production server  
- **`next lint`** – Run ESLint  
- **`next telemetry`** – Opt in/out of telemetry  
- **`next export`** – Static export  
- **`next info`** – Environment info  

You can pass flags like `--turbo` or `--port 4000`. There’s no big standalone “Next.js CLI tool” beyond these — it’s all part of the `next` binary.  

Want me to list all `next` CLI flags and hidden commands?

How do I install?

---

## Assistant

To install the Next.js CLI, you just install Next.js — the `next` command comes with it.  

For a new project:  
```bash
# With npm
npx create-next-app@latest my-app

# With yarn
yarn create next-app my-app

# With pnpm
pnpm create next-app my-app
```

This sets up Next.js and gives you the `next` CLI in `node_modules/.bin/next` (accessible via `npx next` or npm scripts).  

If you already have a project and just need the CLI:  
```bash
npm install next react react-dom
```

Then you can run:  
```bash
npx next dev
```

Do you want me to give you a **full command list** for the Next.js CLI so you know exactly what’s available?
