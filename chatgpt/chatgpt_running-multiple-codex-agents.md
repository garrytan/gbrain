With codex cli can i run multiple agents at once? Do they still run in the cloud or locallly?

---

## Assistant

Codex CLI can launch multiple agents in parallel, yes. You typically start each agent in its own terminal session (or background process), and they’ll all run simultaneously.  

Where they execute depends on how you configured the CLI:

- **Local mode:** If you installed Codex CLI and run it directly on your machine with local models or local runtime, the agents’ code runs on your computer.  
- **Cloud-backed mode:** If you pointed the CLI to a Codex (or OpenAI) API key or a managed Codex service, each agent’s reasoning happens on the provider’s servers, even though you trigger it from the CLI.

So you can spin up multiple local agents, multiple cloud agents, or a mix—just start them separately and manage their environment variables / API keys as needed.

I have open ai plus...how to set it up to run multiple agents in the cloud

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — short and to the point:

### TL;DR
- **Yes**, you can run multiple Codex agents/tasks **in parallel**.
- With **ChatGPT Plus**, Codex runs your tasks in **OpenAI cloud sandboxes**; the CLI is just your controller. citeturn1search0turn1search14

---

### Set it up (Plus → Codex CLI → multiple agents)

1. **Install & auth**
   ```bash
   # macOS (example)
   brew install openai/codex/codex
   codex
   ```
   When prompted, **sign in with your ChatGPT account** (Plus). That links Codex to your Plus plan (no API billing needed). citeturn1search6turn1search4

2. **Pick a repo/workspace**  
   From the Codex prompt, select your local repo (Codex mirrors it into a cloud sandbox per task). citeturn1search0

3. **(Optional) Enable internet access per environment**  
   In the Codex settings for the workspace, toggle **Agent internet access** if your tests/builds need it (it’s off by default; Plus can enable it). citeturn1search14

4. **Run multiple agents**
   - Open **multiple terminals/tmux panes**, `cd` to the same or different repos, and run `codex` in each.  
   - Start a task in each session (every task = its own **cloud** container).  
   - You can also kick off **multiple tasks inside one session**; Codex runs them in parallel sandboxes. citeturn1search0

5. **(Nice-to-have) Session management**
   - Use separate Git worktrees or folders to keep contexts clean.
   - Community tools exist if you want a dashboard for many sessions (e.g., CCManager). citeturn1search5

---

### Reality checks & limits
- **Plus vs API:** Plus gives you Codex in ChatGPT/Codex clients; it’s **separate from API billing** (you don’t need an API key unless you choose to). citeturn0search8
- **Concurrency:** You can run many tasks/agents at once, but **rate/usage limits** still apply by plan. Avoid sharing one session context across concurrent runs; start separate sessions/tasks. citeturn0search4
- **Where code runs:** builds/tests/edits happen in **OpenAI’s cloud sandbox containers**, not on your laptop. The CLI only streams logs/patches. citeturn1search0

If you want, tell me the repos you’re targeting and whether you need internet-on builds; I’ll give you a minimal tmux layout + commands to spin up 3–5 parallel agents cleanly.

Can I tell windsurf cascade to laugh multiple cloud codex agents for tasks?

---

## Assistant

You can’t literally “tell Cascade to launch multiple Codex agents” as a single built-in command, but you can coordinate the two tools so that Cascade spins up several **parallel Codex tasks in the cloud**.

Here’s how it’s normally done:

**1. Use Cascade to script the workflow**  
Cascade lets you chain steps and run shell commands. In your plan (e.g., `plan.md`) you can include multiple steps that each call a terminal command. Example:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: start-agent-1
    run: codex task "refactor frontend"
  - name: start-agent-2
    run: codex task "update tests"
  - name: start-agent-3
    run: codex task "docs sweep"
    parallel: true
```

Setting `parallel: true` (or running them in separate steps with `&` in plain bash) lets Cascade trigger them at the same time.

**2. Codex runs in OpenAI’s cloud**  
Each `codex task` you start is an isolated cloud sandbox. Your local machine (or the Cascade runner) just issues the commands and streams logs.

**3. Practical tips**  
* Give each task a unique name so you can check logs separately.  
* If tasks share a repo, use branches or worktrees so patches don’t clash.  
* Watch your OpenAI rate limits—Plus handles several concurrent sandboxes, but you still don’t want dozens of simultaneous heavy builds.

So yes: Cascade can *orchestrate* multiple Codex cloud agents—just express each agent as a parallel step or background command in your Cascade plan.
