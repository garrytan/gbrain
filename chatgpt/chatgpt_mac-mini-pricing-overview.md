Mac mini pricing depends heavily on chip (M2 vs M4), RAM, and storage. Current realistic ranges:

### Base / entry models
- product["turn0product2","Mac mini M4 (16GB / 256GB)",{"render_as":"hero","description":"Latest base model with M4 chip and 16GB RAM, strong default for most users."}]  
- Typically **$599 retail** citeturn0news18  
- Seen discounted around **$499–$599**

### Older / budget option
- product["turn0product3","Mac mini M2 (8GB / 256GB)",{"render_as":"block","description":"Cheaper previous-gen model, weaker baseline RAM."}]  
- Around **$399–$599**

### Mid-tier configs (more RAM/storage)
- 24GB / 512GB configs: **~$800–$900**  
- Good for dev work, music production, light AI

### High-end / Pro models
- product["turn0product15","Mac mini M4 Pro (24GB+)",{"render_as":"block","description":"Higher core count and bandwidth for heavy workloads."}]  
- Starts ~**$1,299+**  
- Can exceed **$2,500+** fully spec’d

---

### Reality right now (important)
- Base $599 models are frequently **sold out or delayed** due to demand from devs running local AI workloads citeturn0news15turn0news21  
- Resale prices can be inflated

---

### Simple takeaway
- **$500–$600** → best value (M4 base)  
- **$800–$1,300** → serious work machine  
- **$1,300+** → pro / heavy compute  

If you want, specify your use (Jovie dev, agents, music production), and I’ll tell you the exact config you should buy.

mac mini to run a local mode like deeep seek 4 pro

---

## Assistant

If your goal is **running local models like DeepSeek / Llama-class models**, the only thing that really matters is:

**RAM (VRAM equivalent on Mac) > bandwidth > CPU**

Mac mini can do it—but only specific configs are viable.

---

## Best overall (minimum viable for real local AI)
product["turn0product2","Mac mini M4 (32GB RAM / 512GB SSD)",{"render_as":"hero","description":"Baseline machine that can run quantized local LLMs up to ~13B–30B with acceptable performance."}]

**What it can handle:**
- 7B–13B models → smooth
- 30B (quantized) → usable but slower
- DeepSeek smaller variants → fine
- Good for: dev, testing agents, light local inference

**Limitation:**  
32GB is a hard ceiling. You will hit it fast with bigger models.

---

## If you’re serious (recommended)
product["turn0product5","Mac mini M4 Pro (64GB RAM)",{"render_as":"block","description":"High-memory config required for running larger local models and multi-agent workflows."}]

**What this unlocks:**
- 30B models → actually usable
- Some 70B (heavily quantized) → borderline but possible
- Multiple agents / embeddings running together
- Much better context window handling

**This is the real floor for “DeepSeek 4 Pro–type usage.”**

---

## Comparison (what actually matters)

| Attribute | entity["turn0product2","M4 32GB"] | entity["turn0product5","M4 Pro 64GB"] |
|---|---:|---:|
| Max usable model size | ~13B–30B | ~30B–70B (quantized) |
| Multi-agent workflows | Limited | Solid |
| Context window headroom | Tight | Comfortable |
| Longevity | 6–12 months | 1–2+ years |
| Price | ~$1k–$1.3k | ~$2.2k+ |

---

## Reality check (important)

- Mac unified memory = your “GPU VRAM” → you cannot upgrade later  
- Local AI demand is exploding → high-RAM Mac minis are often **sold out** citeturn0news21  
- RAM matters more than CPU speed for LLMs  
- Disk size doesn’t matter much (models can sit external)

---

## Straight answer

- **Don’t buy 16GB. Useless for this.**
- **32GB = entry level**
- **64GB = correct decision**
- If you want to push bigger models → skip Mac mini entirely → go PC w/ GPU

---

## What I’d do for Jovie (your use case)

- If this is **agent infra + experimentation** → 64GB Mac mini is clean
- If this becomes **core product infra** → move to:
  - cloud GPUs, or  
  - local RTX 4090 box

---

If you want, I’ll map:
- exact models you can run (DeepSeek variants)
- tokens/sec benchmarks
- or best local stack (Ollama vs LM Studio vs vLLM)

---

## User

how mch for a 4090 card

---

## Assistant

Short answer: **~$2,200–$3,000 for a legit RTX 4090 right now**.

---

## Real market examples
product["turn0product1","MSI GeForce RTX 4090 Gaming X Trio",{"render_as":"hero","description":"Typical high-end 4090 model; strong cooling and common pricing baseline."}]

product["turn0product3","PNY RTX 4090 24GB Verto",{"render_as":"block","description":"Lower-end AIB model; usually among the cheaper legit options."}]

product["turn0product5","ASUS ROG Strix RTX 4090 OC",{"render_as":"block","description":"Premium version with higher clocks and pricing."}]

---

## What you actually pay (2026 reality)

| Tier | Price |
|---|---|
| MSRP (original) | ~$1,599 citeturn0search8 |
| “good deal” used | ~$1,200–$1,600 citeturn0search0 |
| typical real price | **$2,200–$2,800** |
| premium models | $3,000+ |

---

## Important (don’t get scammed)

- Fake 4090s are now **extremely convincing** — even repair experts get fooled citeturn0news15  
- Anything **under ~$1,000 new is almost guaranteed fake or broken**
- Stick to trusted sellers only

---

## Straight recommendation

- **Best value target:** ~$2,200–$2,400  
- **Safe buy:** ~$2,400–$2,800  
- **Avoid:** anything “too cheap”  

---

## Context for your use case (local AI)

- 4090 = **24GB VRAM**  
- That alone is **~3–4× more usable than a Mac mini 64GB** for LLMs  
- This is the **entry point for serious local DeepSeek-level work**

---

If you want, I can map:
- exact models you can run on a 4090 vs Mac mini  
- or full build cost (CPU + PSU + case) for a local AI rig

---

## User

so if i run a box with this. i can just run 24/7 models? is opencode cheap?

---

## Assistant

Yes. A 4090 box can run local models 24/7. The constraints are **power, thermals, uptime stability, and model size**.

---

## What “24/7” actually looks like

**Feasible:**
- Continuous inference (chat, agents, embeddings)
- Background jobs (indexing, scraping, pipelines)
- Multiple lightweight models at once

**You need:**
- 1000W+ PSU (stable power headroom)
- Good airflow (4090 runs hot under load)
- Linux preferred (Ubuntu) for stability
- Watchdog + auto-restart (systemd or Docker)
- Optional UPS if uptime matters

---

## Cost to run (monthly)

- GPU draw: ~300–450W under load  
- Full system: ~500–700W  

In Los Angeles (~$0.20–$0.30/kWh):
- **~$80–$150/month** running heavy
- Lower if intermittent

---

## Model reality on a 4090 (24GB VRAM)

**Comfortable:**
- 7B, 13B → fast
- 30B (quantized) → solid

**Stretch:**
- 70B (4-bit quant) → works but slower / tighter

**Not realistic locally:**
- Frontier models like DeepSeek-V3 full precision

---

## “Is open code cheap?”

Depends what you mean:

### 1. Local open-source models (what you’re doing)
- **Cost = hardware + electricity**
- Marginal cost per request → near zero
- Extremely cheap at scale

### 2. API-based “open models” (DeepSeek, etc.)
- Still cheap vs GPT-4-class APIs
- But not free at scale
- You lose control + latency benefits

---

## Economics (important)

Once you own the 4090:

- 1,000 requests → basically free
- 1,000,000 requests → still near free
- Break-even vs APIs happens fast

This is why people run local infra.

---

## What this unlocks for Jovie

- Always-on agents (no per-call cost anxiety)
- Real-time personalization loops
- Background fan intelligence / scoring
- Full control over prompts + data

---

## Recommended stack

Keep it simple:

- **entity["software","Ollama","local LLM runtime"]** → easiest
- **entity["software","vLLM","high performance inference server"]** → scale later
- **entity["software","Docker","container platform"]** → reliability
- **entity["software","Ubuntu","Linux distribution"]** → stability

---

## Straight answer

- Yes, you can run models 24/7 reliably  
- Yes, it becomes extremely cheap per request  
- 4090 is the correct entry point for serious local AI  

---

If you want, I can design:
- exact Jovie agent architecture on a 4090 box  
- or a minimal “ship tomorrow” setup that runs nonstop without babysitting
