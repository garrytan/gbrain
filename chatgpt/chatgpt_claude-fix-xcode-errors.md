## User

Is there a way to have Claude code or windsurf cascade look at build errors from Xcode and fix them without me having to have Xcode open and copy the errors manually?

## Assistant

Yes. You’ve got a couple good “no-Xcode-UI, no manual copy/paste” paths, Mr. White.

**1) Claude Code can just run `xcodebuild` itself and read the errors.**  
Claude Code lives in your terminal and can execute shell commands and see their stdout/stderr, so you can tell it to build/test and then fix what it sees. People use it exactly this way for Xcode projects. citeturn2search0turn2search3turn0search7

Example flow:
```bash
cd /path/to/YourApp
claude
```
Then in chat:
- “Run an iOS simulator build for scheme X and fix any compile errors.”
- Claude runs something like:
  ```bash
  xcodebuild -scheme YourScheme -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build
  ```
- It reads the errors right in the terminal output and edits files to fix, repeating until clean.

If logs are huge, you can do:
```bash
xcodebuild ... build | tee build.log
```
and tell Claude: “Read build.log and fix the errors.” (Claude Code supports piping / reading files directly.) citeturn2search3

**2) Even better: add the XcodeBuild MCP server so Claude/Windsurf get “build tools” instead of raw logs.**  
There’s an MCP server called **XcodeBuildMCP** that exposes build/test/run as structured tools. Once installed, your agent can build, parse errors, and iterate autonomously (no Xcode window needed). It explicitly supports Claude Code and Windsurf. citeturn3view0

Install for Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add XcodeBuildMCP npx xcodebuildmcp@latest
```
Then in Claude Code you can say:
- “Use XcodeBuildMCP to build the iOS sim target and fix failures until it passes.”  
Claude will call the MCP build tool, see parsed failures, and patch code. citeturn3view0

Install for Windsurf/Cascade (in MCP config):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "XcodeBuildMCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "xcodebuildmcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```
After that, Cascade can trigger builds and read results through MCP tools, not you. citeturn3view0

**3) What Windsurf Cascade can’t do by itself (yet).**  
Out of the box, Cascade fixes *errors it can see inside the editor*—you highlight an error and hit “Explain and Fix.” It doesn’t automatically slurp Xcode’s GUI build log unless you run the build in a terminal it controls or via MCP. citeturn0search19

So for Windsurf without MCP, the nearest workaround is:
- run `xcodebuild` in Windsurf’s terminal panel,  
- then ask Cascade to fix based on that terminal output / log file you open in the editor.

**Quick recommendation:**  
- If you’re already using **Claude Code**, just let it run `xcodebuild` and iterate.  
- If you want the smoothest loop in either Claude Code *or* Windsurf, set up **XcodeBuildMCP**.

If you want, tell me your current build command (scheme/workspace/destination) and I’ll write a tight one-liner that produces the cleanest AI-parsable output.
