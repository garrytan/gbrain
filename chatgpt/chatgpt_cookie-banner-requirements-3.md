## Assistant

A cookie banner is legally required in jurisdictions that mandate **prior consent** before storing or accessing non-essential cookies (e.g., analytics, advertising, tracking).

## 🇪🇺 European Union  
image_group{"layout":"carousel","aspect_ratio":"1:1","query":["European Union flag","GDPR logo official","cookie consent banner example EU website","website cookie settings modal EU"],"num_per_query":1}
Required under:
- **entity["legislation","General Data Protection Regulation","eu 2016 regulation"] (GDPR)**
- **entity["legislation","ePrivacy Directive","eu 2002 directive"]**

**Rule:**  
You must obtain **opt-in consent** before placing any non-essential cookies (analytics, ads, tracking).  
Pre-checked boxes or implied consent are not compliant.

Applies to:
- Any company **serving EU residents**, regardless of where the company is located.

## 🇬🇧 United Kingdom  
image_group{"layout":"carousel","aspect_ratio":"1:1","query":["United Kingdom flag","UK GDPR logo","ICO cookie guidance page screenshot","UK website cookie consent example"],"num_per_query":1}
Required under:
- **entity["legislation","UK GDPR","uk data protection regulation"]**
- **entity["organization","Information Commissioner's Office","uk regulator"] (ICO) guidance**

**Rule:**  
Same as EU — prior opt-in consent for non-essential cookies.

## 🇨🇦 Canada  
image_group{"layout":"carousel","aspect_ratio":"1:1","query":["Canada flag","PIPEDA logo","Canadian website cookie notice example","privacy policy Canada website example"],"num_per_query":1}
Under:
- **entity["legislation","Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act","canada privacy law"] (PIPEDA)**

**Rule:**  
Implied consent may be allowed in some cases, but transparency is required.  
A banner is common practice but not always mandatory in strict opt-in form.

## 🇺🇸 United States (Including California)

image_group{"layout":"carousel","aspect_ratio":"1:1","query":["United States flag","California flag","CCPA website opt out link example","Do Not Sell My Personal Information link example"],"num_per_query":1}

Under:
- **entity["legislation","California Consumer Privacy Act","2018 california law"] (CCPA)**
- **entity["legislation","California Privacy Rights Act","2020 california amendment"] (CPRA)**

**Rule (California):**
- No strict opt-in cookie banner required.
- But you must provide:
  - Notice of data collection.
  - “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link if using cross-context behavioral advertising cookies.
  - Ability to opt out.

Other states (Virginia, Colorado, etc.) have similar opt-out frameworks.

If you're operating a startup site that serves traffic globally, the conservative move is:

**Show a GDPR-compliant opt-in banner to everyone.**

If you want, tell me:
- Where your company is based  
- Where your users are located  

I’ll give you the lowest-risk compliance setup.
