## User

use agent mode to properly setup all these dns records on our vercel account

---

## Assistant

Mr. White — I can use your browser to do that for you.

Just to confirm before I proceed:

**I can use your browser to add the required CNAME records to your Vercel project's domain settings and complete the Clerk DNS verification. Would you like me to continue?**

---

## User

yes

## Assistant

All the specified DNS records for **jovie.app** have been added in your Vercel dashboard. The CNAME records for the Clerk frontend, accounts portal, email, and DKIM (both keys) have been created, and they now appear in the domain’s DNS records list on Vercel【837415731703803†screenshot】.

Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to adjust!

## User

lets set the remaining email keys for jov.ie from clerk in vercel

---

## Assistant

I tried to set up the remaining Clerk email DNS records (`clkmail`, `clk._domainkey`, and `clk2._domainkey`) for **jov.ie** in your Vercel dashboard. When I attempted to create the `clk._domainkey` CNAME record pointing to `dkim1.q8hu5eykn7u7.clerk.services`, Vercel reported a conflict because a CNAME record with the same name already exists, pointing to a different Clerk DKIM host. Similar conflicts exist for the other records—Vercel’s UI indicates that these names already have CNAME records pointing to the previous Clerk configuration. Since Vercel requires unique names for CNAME records, it will not allow adding new records until the old ones are removed.

Additionally, the domain’s nameservers are still set to a third‑party provider (Vercel displays a banner prompting to “update the nameservers in your DNS provider to manage your DNS records on Vercel”), so these DNS records cannot be modified from Vercel until the nameservers are pointed to `ns1.vercel-dns.com` and `ns2.vercel-dns.com`.

Please let me know if you’d like to:

- Update the domain’s nameservers to Vercel so you can manage DNS records there, **or**
- Remove/modify the existing `clkmail`, `clk._domainkey`, and `clk2._domainkey` CNAME records via your current DNS provider before attempting to add the new Clerk values.

Once the nameserver or record conflicts are resolved, I can proceed with adding the updated email keys.

## User

try adding again

---

## Assistant

I attempted to add the remaining Clerk email DNS records for **jov.ie** again. I set up the `clk2._domainkey` record in the form (CNAME pointing to `dkim2.q8hu5eykn7u7.clerk.services`), but Vercel’s DNS interface still shows an error. The form displays a conflict message saying there is already a CNAME record with the same name (`clkmail`) pointing to a different target on this domain【179354144683044†screenshot】. Because of this, the “Add” button is not available and the new record cannot be saved.

It appears that the existing `clkmail`, `clk._domainkey`, or `clk2._domainkey` records still exist in the DNS configuration and block adding new CNAMEs. Additionally, the domain is still configured with third‑party nameservers, so Vercel cannot fully manage its DNS until the nameservers are pointed to Vercel.

To proceed, these existing records would need to be removed or updated via the current DNS provider, or the domain’s nameservers need to be changed to Vercel’s nameservers. Only then will Vercel allow adding or modifying the CNAME records for Clerk. Let me know how you would like to handle these existing records or if you’d like to update the nameservers.
