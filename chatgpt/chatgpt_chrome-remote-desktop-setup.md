Mr. White — here’s a concise overview of Chrome Remote Desktop (CRD) — what it is, how to set it up, and key considerations.

---

### What it is  
- CRD is a remote-access tool from entity["organization", "Google", 0] that lets you connect from one device (computer, tablet, phone) to another: view files, run programs, share screen or control remote PC. citeturn0search0turn0search3turn0search4turn0search1  
- It supports major platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS for hosts; clients can be on desktop or mobile (iOS/Android) too. citeturn0search4turn0search2turn0search3  
- There are two main modes:  
  1. **Remote access** (set up a host machine you can access anytime)  
  2. **Remote support / screen-sharing** (one-time code, share session) citeturn0search3turn0search0

### How to set it up  
Here’s a basic workflow for your scenario (you’re in Los Angeles, so regarding typical home/work network conditions apply).  
1. On the computer you’ll *host* (the one you’ll access Remote):  
   - Open Chrome browser and go to [remotedesktop.google.com/access](https://remotedesktop.google.com/access). citeturn0search3turn0search0  
   - Click “Set up Remote Access”. Download and install the host component (may require admin privileges). citeturn0search3  
   - Choose a **machine name** and set a **PIN** for access.  
   - Make sure the machine is online, awake, has internet.  

2. On the client side (the device you’ll use to connect in):  
   - Either in Chrome browser go to same URL, or install the mobile app (Android / iOS) from the store. citeturn0search2turn0search0  
   - Sign in with the same Google account (or the account tied to the host)  
   - Select the machine, supply the PIN, connect.

3. For screen-sharing / support scenario (less permanent):  
   - On the host machine go to [remotedesktop.google.com/support](https://remotedesktop.google.com/support) → Generate access code → share with the person you want to allow. citeturn0search3

### Key benefits & limitations  
**Pros:**  
- Free to use for most personal/remote-access cases.  
- Cross-platform and relatively simple to set up.  
- Secure: uses encryption, and Google infrastructure. citeturn0search3turn0search4  

**Cons / things to watch:**  
- It lacks some advanced enterprise features (e.g., more granular access controls, file-transfer or print routing may be limited) depending on your needs. citeturn0news12turn0news16  
- Performance depends heavily on network (latency, bandwidth) — if you’re accessing from a remote location (e.g., mobile over cellular), may be slower.  
- For host machines behind strict corporate firewalls, proxy or port restrictions, you may face issues. CRD uses certain protocols and ports. citeturn0search3

### Practical tips for your setup  
Since you’re a startup founder (with likely mixed devices/no doubt some remote working), here are some tailored tips:  
- **Use a strong, unique PIN** for the host device and ensure your Google account has 2-step verification enabled.  
- **Ensure host machine stays awake** (disable sleep or hibernation) if you plan to access it anytime.  
- **Test from different networks** (both local LAN and remote) beforehand so you’re comfortable with how it works.  
- **Label machines clearly** (e.g., “Home-Mac”, “Office-PC”) so you don’t accidentally connect to wrong one.  
- **Security**: If you allow others support access, monitor the remote session and terminate when done.  
- **Backup access option**: Since CRD is free and convenient, it’s great for personal use — but if you scale to more devices/users, consider complementing with a more enterprise-oriented remote access tool with advanced features.
