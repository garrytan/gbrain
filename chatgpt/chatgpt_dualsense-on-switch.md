## User

Dog, if I get a PlayStation DualSense controller, can I use that with a Switch or a Switch 2?

Yes — you **can** use a **entity["turn0product0","Sony DualSense Wireless Controller",1]** (or any PS5 DualSense) with a **Nintendo Switch** *and* likely a **Nintendo Switch 2**, but **not natively**. Here’s the reality:

### 🎮 Original Nintendo Switch
- The Switch **does not support DualSense controllers on its own** — no Bluetooth pairing directly.  
- You **need a controller adapter** (USB dongle) that sits in the Switch dock’s USB port (or USB-C on the handheld) and makes the Switch think your PS5 controller is a supported gamepad. citeturn0search12  
- With the right adapter (like a USB wireless adapter from 8BitDo or similar), you can use DualSense to play Switch games. citeturn0search12

### 🆕 Nintendo Switch 2
- Same basic situation: **no official native DualSense support** from Nintendo either.  
- Third-party adapters (Magic-NS, 8BitDo Wireless USB Adapter 2, etc.) **can make DualSense work**. citeturn0search19  
- Some reports and videos show the DualSense working on Switch 2 with these dongles. citeturn0search1

### ❗Important Limitations
- **DualSense special features** (adaptive triggers, advanced haptics, mic, audio jack) do **not work** on Switch/Switch 2 — only basic buttons and sticks. citeturn0search12  
- You typically need either:  
  - A **USB wireless adapter** plugged into the dock or USB-C port, *or*  
  - A **dedicated Bluetooth adapter/converter** that bridges the controller and console.

### Recommended Adapter Examples
Here are some controller adapters that *might* help (quality varies — check reviews):

- **entity["turn0product2","AOLION Bluetooth Wireless Controller Adapter for PS4/PS5/Swi",0]** — Bluetooth adapter for DualSense to Switch.  
- **entity["turn0product10","DS50 Pro Gamepad Converter USB Receiver for Switch 2 PS5 PS4",0]** — simple USB dongle.  
- **entity["turn0product12","PS5 PS4 Switch XBox One Wii Wireless Controller Adapter For",0]** — broad controller converter.  
- **entity["turn0product13","USB Wireless Bluetooth Adapter Game Controller Receiver for",0]** — inexpensive generic Bluetooth adapter.  

Adapters differ widely in reliability and latency — some are better than others.

**Bottom line:** You *can* use a DualSense with both the original Switch and the Switch 2, but only through a third-party adapter and without the advanced DualSense features working.

Is the adapter just any USB Bluetooth adapter?

No — it **can’t be just any random USB Bluetooth adapter** like the cheap generic dongles meant for audio or PC Bluetooth. Switch/Switch 2 **don’t have native support** for DualSense Bluetooth, so what matters isn’t generic Bluetooth capability but **protocol translation** that makes the Dock/Console think a supported controller is connected. citeturn0search20turn0search21

You need a **controller adapter/dongle made for console controllers** — basically a USB Bluetooth bridge with firmware that maps DualSense signals into something the Switch can understand. These are built specifically for gamepads and handle pairing, input translation, and button mapping. citeturn0search20

Good options that work for Switch/Switch 2 include:

**Reliable controller-compatible adapters**
- **entity["turn0product0","8BitDo USB Wireless Adapter",1]** – very popular, works with PS5 DualSense and many other controllers.  
- **entity["turn0product7","8BitDo USB Wireless Controller Adapter 2 Converter Dongle",1]** – updated version with broader compatibility.  
- **entity["turn0product6","Hzewls Bigbig WON R90 Gamepad USB Adapter for NS Switch Ps4/"]** – decent budget choice.  
- **entity["turn0product2","Mayflash Magic-NS Wireless Controller Adapter"]** – another widely used controller adapter.

**Avoid cheap “Bluetooth” dongles** that aren’t designed for gamepad bridging (e.g., basic $10 generic USB Bluetooth adapters), because they generally won’t pair DualSense to the Switch. Those dongles only give Bluetooth radio and **not the translation layer** the console needs. citeturn0search20

**Summary:**  
✔ You need a USB controller adapter with built-in gamepad support.  
✘ A generic PC Bluetooth USB dongle won’t work for DualSense on Switch or Switch 2. citeturn0search20  

If you want the simplest, most dependable choice, go for the 8BitDo adapter model.
