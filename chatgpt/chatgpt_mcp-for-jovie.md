## User

https://www.stainless.com/products/mcp/ is this useful for jovie

---

## Assistant

I’ll evaluate Stainless MCP against Jovie’s public product surface, focusing on API exposure, developer/customer workflows, AI-agent integrations, implementation effort, and practical ROI.

---

## Assistant

Mr. White, **yes — useful for Jovie, but mainly as API/developer infrastructure.** I’d treat it as a **medium-priority platform investment**, not a core artist-facing feature.

## Why it fits Jovie

Jovie already has a public API direction: the docs say the Jovie API is a **RESTful JSON API**, authenticated by API key or OAuth token, with planned areas for **profiles, releases, audience, and analytics**. The docs also say the API reference is still under development. citeturn562045view0

Stainless MCP is designed for that exact situation: it generates an MCP server from an **OpenAPI spec**, and lets AI agents interact with the API through SDK code plus docs search. citeturn497061view0

## Where it would create value

For Jovie, the best use cases would be:

| Use case | Value |
|---|---|
| **Label / manager automation** | “Create smart links for 200 upcoming releases,” “pull weekly analytics for all artists,” “update artist profiles from a spreadsheet.” |
| **AI agents using Jovie’s API** | Lets Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT-style agents, or internal tools call Jovie reliably through SDK code. |
| **Partner integrations** | Makes it easier for distributors, labels, and catalog owners to connect their systems to Jovie. |
| **Internal ops tooling** | Your team could use agent workflows for bulk QA, data cleanup, campaign generation, and analytics exports. |
| **Developer credibility** | If Jovie becomes an infrastructure layer for music catalog monetization, SDK + MCP support signals seriousness. |

This maps well to Jovie’s product surface: releases/smart links, pre-save flows, audience segmentation, analytics, and AI-assisted fan communication. citeturn987938view0turn987938view1turn987938view2turn987938view3

## Why Stainless specifically

Stainless’s MCP product is stronger than a basic “one endpoint = one MCP tool” setup. Their approach exposes two tools — docs search and code execution — so agents write TypeScript against the generated SDK instead of choosing from a huge endpoint list. citeturn942612view0turn497061view0

That matters if Jovie’s API grows across artists, profiles, releases, campaigns, audience, analytics, tips, chat, and reporting. Stainless says this keeps token usage and tool complexity more stable as endpoint count increases. citeturn447700view1

## When I’d use it

**Use it now if:**

- Jovie already has or is about to ship a real `api.jov.ie/v1`.
- You want labels/managers/distributors to automate workflows.
- You want Jovie to be usable by AI coding agents.
- You already maintain an OpenAPI spec or can create one quickly.

**Defer it if:**

- The API is still mostly aspirational.
- No external partner needs API access yet.
- Your highest-leverage work is still artist onboarding, activation, or core campaign UX.
- The API surface will change heavily in the next few weeks.

## Recommended path

I’d do a **small private pilot**, not a broad launch.

1. Write a clean OpenAPI spec for 10–20 core endpoints:
   - artists/profiles
   - releases
   - smart links
   - pre-saves
   - audience segments
   - analytics exports

2. Generate:
   - TypeScript SDK
   - API docs
   - private MCP server

3. Test with 5–10 realistic agent tasks:
   - “Create a pre-save campaign for this release.”
   - “Show top-performing links for an artist this month.”
   - “Export audience segments by city.”
   - “Generate a campaign report for a label roster.”
   - “Update artist profile metadata from a CSV.”

4. Keep it private until partner demand is obvious.

Stainless pricing appears prototype-friendly: their free plan lists up to **5 generators**, and a generator can be an SDK, docs site, or MCP server; the free tier also lists an API size limit of **≤25 endpoints**. citeturn497061view1turn993718view2

## Bottom line

**Useful for Jovie if you want Jovie to become API-first for labels, managers, distributors, and AI agents.**  

I’d prioritize it after the API spec is stable enough to support real partner workflows. The first milestone should be a private Stainless-generated SDK + MCP for internal and label-facing automation, then decide whether to expose it publicly.

## User

should we use anthroics agents sdk

---

## Assistant

I’ll verify Anthropic’s current agent tooling, then assess whether it fits Jovie across ops automation, partner/API workflows, artist-facing features, MCP integration, and production risk.

---

## Assistant

Mr. White, **yes, but only for specific Jovie workflows.** I would **not** make Anthropic’s Agent SDK the foundation of Jovie’s external platform. I would use it as an **internal/partner automation layer** on top of Jovie’s own API and MCP server.

## Recommendation

**Use Anthropic’s Claude Agent SDK for:**

| Area | Use it? | Reason |
|---|---:|---|
| Internal engineering agents | **Yes** | Strong fit for codebase tasks, QA, debugging, release ops, and scripted workflows. |
| Internal business/ops agents | **Yes** | Useful for campaign QA, analytics summaries, artist onboarding checks, CSV/spreadsheet workflows. |
| Label/manager automation prototypes | **Yes** | Good for testing “agentic” workflows before building deterministic product UX. |
| Public Jovie API platform | **No** | Keep this model-agnostic through REST/OpenAPI + MCP. |
| Core customer-facing product flows | **Maybe later** | Use only after narrow workflows are proven reliable and auditable. |

## Why it is useful

Anthropic’s Agent SDK gives you the same agent loop, tools, and context-management behavior that powers Claude Code, exposed in Python and TypeScript. It includes built-in capabilities like reading files, editing files, running commands, searching the web, handling sessions, MCP connectivity, permissions, hooks, checkpointing, usage tracking, and OpenTelemetry observability. citeturn552122view0

That is useful for Jovie because a lot of label/artist workflows are multi-step:

- “Audit this artist’s campaign setup.”
- “Find releases missing smart links.”
- “Generate weekly analytics summaries for a manager.”
- “Import this roster spreadsheet and create draft campaigns.”
- “Check that all pre-save campaigns have correct metadata.”
- “Compare Spotify/Apple/YouTube link coverage across a catalog.”

Those are good agent tasks. They involve files, API calls, conditional logic, and human review.

## How it should fit with Stainless/MCP

The right architecture is:

```text
Jovie API
   ↓
OpenAPI spec
   ↓
SDKs + MCP server
   ↓
Claude Agent SDK / OpenAI Agents SDK / Cursor / Claude Desktop / partner tools
```

The **Jovie API and MCP server** should be the durable platform layer. The **Anthropic Agent SDK** should be one way to build agents that use that platform.

Anthropic created MCP as an open standard for connecting AI systems to tools and data sources, and its docs describe MCP as a way to avoid fragmented custom integrations. citeturn552122view2 Anthropic also announced on **May 18, 2026** that it is acquiring Stainless, describing Stainless as a company that turns API specs into SDKs, CLIs, and MCP servers. citeturn778295view0

That makes the Stainless + Anthropic ecosystem more strategically aligned now. For Jovie, the better move is still **API/MCP first**, then agent SDKs second.

## Where Anthropic’s SDK beats a basic LLM integration

Use the Agent SDK when the task requires:

- Multiple tool calls.
- File inspection or editing.
- Running scripts.
- Session state.
- Human approvals.
- Observability.
- Rollback/checkpoint behavior.
- MCP tool access.
- Internal automation with controlled permissions.

Anthropic’s docs explicitly frame the Agent SDK as a library for production automation and custom applications, while the standard client SDK is for direct API access where you implement the tool loop yourself. citeturn552122view0

## Where I would avoid it

I would avoid using it as the default for simple Jovie features like:

- Basic chat support.
- Artist bio generation.
- Campaign copy generation.
- Simple analytics summaries.
- Smart-link creation from a form.
- Deterministic onboarding flows.

For those, use direct model calls or normal product logic. Agent SDKs add complexity: tool permissions, session state, audit trails, retries, cost controls, and failure handling.

## Anthropic Agent SDK vs Managed Agents

Anthropic’s docs distinguish the **Agent SDK** from **Managed Agents**:

| Option | Runs where | Better for |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent SDK** | Your infrastructure | Local prototyping, internal automations, agents that work directly with your files/services. |
| **Managed Agents** | Anthropic-managed infrastructure | Production agents where you do not want to operate sandbox/session infrastructure. |

Anthropic’s docs say a common path is to prototype with the Agent SDK locally, then move to Managed Agents for production. citeturn552122view0

For Jovie, I would start with the **Agent SDK**, because you want control while testing agent reliability.

## Anthropic vs OpenAI Agents SDK

OpenAI also has an Agents SDK with agents, tools, handoffs, guardrails, structured outputs, sessions, orchestration, and tracing. citeturn813783search0 It also supports non-OpenAI and mixed-provider setups, though OpenAI models are the default path. citeturn813783search2

My practical recommendation:

| Layer | Use |
|---|---|
| **Jovie API** | Model-agnostic REST API. |
| **Jovie MCP server** | Model-agnostic agent access. |
| **Anthropic Agent SDK** | Internal Claude-heavy workflows, especially code/file/tool-heavy agents. |
| **OpenAI Agents SDK** | Customer-facing or multi-agent product workflows where OpenAI models/tools are preferred. |
| **Direct API calls** | Simple, deterministic AI features. |

## Best first Jovie experiment

Build one internal agent:

**“Jovie Campaign Ops Agent”**

Capabilities:

- Read a CSV of artists/releases.
- Call Jovie API.
- Create draft smart links/pre-save campaigns.
- Flag missing metadata.
- Generate manager-facing campaign summaries.
- Require approval before writing live changes.

Use Anthropic Agent SDK with:

- Jovie MCP server.
- Read-only mode first.
- Strict write approvals.
- Tool allowlists.
- Cost tracking.
- Full run logs.

## Bottom line

**Use Anthropic’s Agent SDK, but do not center Jovie’s platform around it.**

The clean strategy:

1. Build Jovie’s API.
2. Generate SDKs and MCP from OpenAPI.
3. Use Anthropic Agent SDK for internal and partner automation pilots.
4. Keep public platform access model-agnostic.
5. Move only proven workflows into customer-facing product surfaces.

## User

should our app just be a front end for our db and agents run locally and update records? or vercel workflow or railway hermes agents or like this or what

---

## Assistant

Mr. White, I’ll evaluate this as a Jovie architecture decision across state, agent execution, write safety, reliability, auditability, latency, cost, and deployment speed.

---

## Assistant

The emerging recommendation is API-first plus durable workflows: agents should be bounded workers inside observable jobs, with controlled writes rather than direct database mutation.

---

## Assistant

Mr. White, use **API-first + durable workflows**.

Do **not** make Jovie “a frontend for the DB where local agents update records.” That creates bad failure modes: unauthorized writes, broken invariants, silent schema drift, no approval boundary, weak auditability, and hard rollbacks.

## Recommended Jovie architecture

```txt
Jovie Web App
Next.js / Vercel
        ↓
Jovie API / Service Layer
Auth, permissions, validation, idempotency, audit logs
        ↓
Postgres
Source of truth
        ↓
Workflow Orchestrator
Vercel Workflow first; Trigger/Inngest if needed
        ↓
Agent Steps
Claude / OpenAI / AI SDK / MCP tools
        ↓
Proposed actions → validators → approved writes
```

## The core rule

**Agents should not write directly to production tables.**

They should produce structured actions like:

```ts
{
  type: "CREATE_SMART_LINK",
  artistId: "...",
  releaseId: "...",
  links: [...],
  confidence: 0.91,
  requiresApproval: true
}
```

Then a deterministic service validates and applies the mutation:

```txt
agent output
  → schema validation
  → permission check
  → business rule check
  → idempotency check
  → human approval if needed
  → API write
  → audit log
```

This lets agents help without turning the database into an unsafe execution target.

## What to use for each layer

| Layer | Recommendation | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Vercel / Next.js | Best fit if Jovie is already web-app-heavy and TypeScript-heavy. |
| **Database** | Postgres | Keep this as the source of truth. Do not expose it directly to agents. |
| **Business writes** | Jovie API / service layer | All writes go through auth, validation, audit, and idempotency. |
| **Simple AI features** | Vercel AI SDK | Good for generation, structured outputs, and provider-agnostic model calls. Vercel says the AI SDK abstracts model providers and supports tool calling. citeturn605995view2 |
| **Durable product workflows** | **Vercel Workflow** | Best first choice if you want durable multi-step agent/product jobs inside your Vercel stack. It supports pause/resume, state, retries, logs, hooks, and durable steps. citeturn748992view1turn748992view2 |
| **Long-running heavy jobs** | Trigger.dev or Railway worker | Use this for browser automation, long syncs, media processing, imports, and jobs that may exceed serverless comfort. Trigger.dev explicitly supports long-running AI tasks, retries, queues, real-time monitoring, and no timeouts. citeturn866149view0turn866149view3 |
| **Event-driven background jobs** | Inngest | Good alternative if you want event-driven durable functions with queueing, scaling, concurrency, throttling, rate limiting, and observability. citeturn866149view1 |
| **Enterprise-grade orchestration** | Temporal later | Strongest durable execution system, but more infra/ops complexity. Temporal defines workflows as durable, reliable, scalable executions that can run seconds to years and recover after failures. citeturn866149view2 |
| **Railway Agent** | DevOps only | Railway’s own agent is for creating/configuring services, inspecting deployments, diagnosing failures, and opening PRs. It is infrastructure automation, not Jovie business logic. citeturn605995view4 |
| **Railway for Agents / MCP** | Infra operations | Railway exposes CLI, local MCP, remote MCP, and skills so coding agents can operate Railway projects and environments. Use this to manage deployments, variables, services, logs, and infra. citeturn605995view3 |
| **Hermes Agent** | R&D / personal ops / experimental internal agent | Hermes is a self-improving autonomous agent with memory, skills, messaging integrations, cron, tool use, and MCP support. Interesting, but too unconstrained for production record mutation. citeturn605995view5turn605995view7 |

## My actual recommendation for Jovie

Use this stack:

```txt
1. Vercel / Next.js
   Frontend, API routes, server actions, auth-gated admin UI

2. Postgres
   Main source of truth

3. Jovie service layer
   All writes go through typed functions:
   createRelease()
   createSmartLink()
   updateArtistProfile()
   createCampaign()
   recordAnalyticsSnapshot()

4. Vercel Workflow
   Default orchestration for:
   - artist onboarding
   - release setup
   - pre-save lifecycle
   - smart-link validation
   - weekly analytics reports
   - campaign QA
   - approval flows

5. Trigger.dev or Railway worker
   Use only when workflows need:
   - long browser automation
   - FFmpeg/media jobs
   - Python-heavy jobs
   - scraping/link checking at scale
   - always-on worker processes

6. Agent SDKs
   Agents run as workflow steps.
   They call Jovie tools/API.
   They generate proposed actions.
   They do not hold unrestricted DB credentials.
```

## Where agents should be used

Good agent use cases for Jovie:

| Workflow | Agent role | Write behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Artist onboarding | Parse artist site, socials, distributor metadata | Draft profile updates |
| Release setup | Find missing links, identify bad URLs, generate campaign copy | Draft smart-link/pre-save setup |
| Weekly analytics | Summarize trends and anomalies | Write report records |
| Label roster import | Normalize CSVs, detect duplicates, flag missing data | Draft updates, require approval |
| Campaign QA | Check broken links, missing pixels, weak copy, bad images | Create issues/tasks |
| Fan segmentation | Suggest segments from behavior | Require approval before messaging |
| Messaging | Draft email/SMS/DM campaigns | Human approval before send |

Bad agent use cases:

| Workflow | Reason |
|---|---|
| Payouts / balances / ledgers | Needs deterministic accounting. |
| Permission changes | High security risk. |
| Deleting records | Needs explicit human approval and soft-delete. |
| Sending fan messages automatically | Brand/legal/spam risk. |
| Updating production DB from local agents | Weak audit and access control. |

## Vercel Workflow vs Trigger.dev vs Railway

### Use Vercel Workflow first when:

- Your app is already on Vercel.
- You want workflows in TypeScript.
- Jobs are product workflows: onboarding, campaign creation, approval flows, scheduled follow-ups.
- You want native Vercel observability and managed state.
- You need pause/resume, sleeps, retries, and human approval hooks.

Vercel Workflow is built for durable applications and AI agents; its docs say Functions execute workflow code, Queues enqueue the routes, and managed persistence stores state and event logs. It supports resumable, durable, observable async workflows. citeturn748992view1

### Use Trigger.dev when:

- You need long-running tasks with no timeout.
- You need browser automation.
- You need FFmpeg, Python scripts, or custom system packages.
- You want a purpose-built AI workflow/job platform.

Trigger.dev’s docs explicitly position it for long-running AI tasks, background jobs, built-in queuing, retries, monitoring, no timeouts, and human-in-the-loop flows. citeturn866149view0turn866149view3

### Use Railway when:

- You need an always-on worker.
- You need a simple containerized service.
- You want background workers close to a Railway-hosted DB/service.
- You want Railway’s agent/MCP tooling for deployment ops.

Do not use “Railway Agent” as Jovie’s business agent runtime. Railway describes it as a dashboard AI assistant for creating services, setting variables, inspecting deployments, diagnosing failures, and opening PRs. citeturn605995view4

### Use Hermes when:

- You want an internal autonomous assistant.
- You want long-lived memory and self-improving skills.
- You want Telegram/Slack/Discord-style ops access.
- You are experimenting.

Do not put Hermes in charge of Jovie production writes. Its self-improving memory/skills model is powerful for a personal or internal agent, but production Jovie mutations need predictable contracts, explicit permissions, and audit trails.

## The database pattern I’d use

Create these tables:

```txt
workflow_runs
agent_tasks
agent_messages
agent_proposals
agent_actions
approval_requests
audit_events
idempotency_keys
external_sync_jobs
```

Key rule:

```txt
agent_proposals = model-generated suggestions
agent_actions   = validated executable actions
audit_events    = immutable record of every applied change
```

Agents can write to `agent_proposals`. Your backend writes to real business tables.

## Example: create smart link flow

```txt
User uploads release
  ↓
createRelease() writes release draft
  ↓
Vercel Workflow starts
  ↓
Step 1: fetch metadata from DSPs
  ↓
Step 2: agent checks missing links / bad URLs
  ↓
Step 3: agent proposes smart-link config
  ↓
Step 4: deterministic validator checks fields
  ↓
Step 5: approval requested if confidence < threshold
  ↓
Step 6: createSmartLink() applies final write
  ↓
Step 7: audit log + notify user
```

## Decision

For Jovie:

**Primary stack:**  
**Vercel app + Postgres + Jovie API + Vercel Workflow + AI SDK/Claude/OpenAI agent steps.**

**Add Trigger.dev** when Vercel Workflow feels too constrained for long-running agents, browser automation, Python, media jobs, or custom runtime dependencies.

**Use Railway** for persistent workers and infra operations.

**Use Hermes** as an experimental internal assistant, not as the production mutation layer.

The main architectural principle: **agents suggest; services decide; workflows orchestrate; APIs write; DB records.**
