## Question

https://exa.ai/ how can this make jovie better and should we adot it

## Answer

I’ll assess Exa’s current product/API capabilities against Jovie’s workflows, then give a practical adoption recommendation with use cases, risks, and a pilot path.

## Answer

Mr. White, **yes — adopt Exa selectively**, starting with a focused pilot. It is a strong fit for Jovie as a **live web-intelligence layer** for the AI artist manager, especially for surfacing artist opportunities, monitoring open-web signals, enriching artist profiles, and grounding AI chat.

## Why Exa fits Jovie

Jovie is positioned as an **AI artist manager** that “watches your catalog,” surfaces next actions, and helps artists ship presaves, fan paths, and playlist pitches. citeturn660166view1 Jovie also has audience segmentation, fan messaging, AI-assisted chat, analytics, and smart-link workflows. citeturn959958view0turn959958view1turn959958view2turn959958view3

Exa’s core value is that it gives AI products live web search, crawling, structured extraction, and recurring monitors through an API. Its docs describe Search, Contents, Deep Search, Agent, Websets, and Monitors as tools for search, crawling, research, list-building, enrichment, and web updates. citeturn497976view0turn497976view1turn542002view0turn542002view1

## Best Jovie use cases

| Use case | How Exa improves Jovie | Priority |
|---|---:|---:|
| **Artist Opportunity Feed** | Find new playlist targets, blogs, curators, radio shows, tastemakers, local promoters, and release-relevant opportunities. | **High** |
| **Web monitoring** | Track new mentions, reviews, playlist placements, live dates, press, creator posts, and competitor/comparable-artist activity. Exa Monitors run scheduled searches, dedupe prior results, and send webhook updates. citeturn542002view0 | **High** |
| **AI chat grounding** | Let the artist/fan AI answer questions with fresher context from official sites, press, release pages, and event listings. Jovie already plans AI-assisted fan replies and common-question handling. citeturn959958view2 | **High** |
| **Profile enrichment** | Auto-suggest bios, social links, press quotes, similar artists, genre tags, and missing metadata from public sources. | Medium |
| **Playlist pitch research** | Generate target lists with evidence: why this curator/blog/radio show is relevant, what they recently covered, and how to pitch. | **High** |
| **Internal artist-manager copilot** | Give Jovie ops/team members fast research summaries on an artist, release, label, distributor, or campaign. | Medium |
| **Lead discovery for partnerships** | Find indie labels, managers, distributors, agencies, and creators that match Jovie’s ICP. Exa has people/company indexes and structured output support. citeturn621390view0 | Medium |

## The feature I would build first

### **“What should I do next?” powered by Exa**

For each artist/release, Jovie could generate a ranked feed like:

> **Pitch this blog**  
> Evidence: covered 3 similar artists in the past 30 days.  
> Suggested action: send a premiere pitch for the new single.  
> Draft: generated outreach copy.  
> Confidence: 82%.

Each recommendation should include:

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| `opportunity_

## Question

plan this as a feature extensively. for artists mentions we need a me/not me type training so that for example tim white doesnt flag every tim white on the internet, etc. 

we also need this organized in a ship first, ship later. and how this materically is structured and benefits mrr at an early stage.

## Answer

I’ll turn this into a feature spec covering UX, data structure, me/not-me training, ship-first versus later scope, and the early MRR case.

## Answer

I’m also grounding the plan around Exa Monitors/webhooks and treating mentions as candidate evidence that feeds a ranked action inbox, with correction loops driving precision and retention.

## Answer

Mr. White, build this as **Jovie Radar**: a web-intelligence layer that finds artist mentions, filters “me / not me,” and turns verified signals into manager-style actions.

The core principle: **do not ship “mentions” as the product. Ship “verified opportunities.”** Mentions are raw material. The revenue feature is: “Jovie found this thing happening on the internet and tells you exactly what to do next.”

Jovie’s existing promise is that it watches an artist’s catalog, surfaces what to do next, and helps them ship presaves, fan paths, or playlist pitches. This feature extends that from catalog intelligence into **open-web intelligence**. citeturn610133view0

# 1. Feature name

## **Jovie Radar**

### One-line product description

> Jovie Radar watches the internet for verified artist mentions, playlist/press opportunities, and market signals, then turns them into source-backed actions.

### User-facing positioning

> “Jovie watches the web for you. When your name, release, or scene moves, Jovie tells you what happened and what to do next.”

# 2. Product thesis

Artists do not need another analytics feed. They need **manager-level context**:

- Who mentioned me?
- Is this actually me?
- Is it worth acting on?
- What should I do?
- Can Jovie help me respond, pitch, share, or follow up?

Exa is useful here because it supports real-time search, clean page extraction, scheduled monitors, structured outputs, and verified/enriched web collections. Exa Monitors can run recurring searches, dedupe new results, produce structured output, and deliver results to a webhook. citeturn882259view0 Exa Contents can extract clean page text, highlights, summaries, and structured information from URLs. citeturn882259view1 Websets can verify and enrich web results against criteria, which is useful later for curator, blog, venue, playlist, and partner discovery. citeturn882259view2

# 3. What should ship first

## Ship first: **Verified Mentions + Opportunity Cards**

The MVP should include five things:

| Component | Description | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Artist Identity Profile** | Stores names, aliases, handles, releases, official URLs, genres, city, collaborators, labels, and known negatives. | Prevents false positives. |
| **Mention Candidate Pipeline** | Uses Exa to find possible artist mentions across the web. | Creates the raw signal. |
| **Me / Not Me Training** | Artist or internal reviewer marks ambiguous results as “Me,” “Not Me,” or “Maybe.” | Makes the system trustworthy. |
| **Identity Scoring** | Each candidate gets a confidence score before it reaches the artist. | Avoids Tim White ≠ every Tim White problem. |
| **Action Cards** | Verified mentions become recommended next steps. | Creates paid value. |

### MVP output example

**Card title:**  
> New blog mention: “The Deep End” included in indie electronic roundup

**Card body:**  
> This appears to be you. The page mentions your artist name, release title, Spotify
