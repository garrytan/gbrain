# Tech Stack Inquiry

## Question

I want ever product stack and or tech stack used at openAI, anthropic, or thinking machines. Specifically interested in stuff  like next.js vs others, auth providers, payment platforms, linters, IDEs, CI, code review and AI tools, etc etc. give me the full stack. Db providers, domain restrirars, cloud flare, email providers like see or mail gun, everything there servers touch or talk to. How they collect feedback

## Answer

To make sure I gather the most relevant and accurate information, could you please clarify the following:

1. Are you looking for the current tech stacks only, or are historical stacks also of interest?
2. Should I prioritize official sources (e.g. engineering blogs, documentation, or interviews) or include developer commentary and investigative reports?
3. Are you interested in stack details for just their core products, or internal tools and infra (e.g. developer tooling, HR systems, analytics) as well?
4. Do you want a comparison between the companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Thinking Machines), or treat them individually?

Once I have this clarified, I’ll get started right away.

## Question

Current
Official or third party as long as its evidence based (like a dev who found references in code or something)
Everything 
Individually 

## Answer

Mr. White — nobody publicly exposes their *entire* internal stack (auth/email/registrars/IDEs/etc.) in a complete, auditable way. Below is the most complete **evidence-backed** “current stack map” I can assemble from **(a) their own job posts/docs**, plus **(b) third-party tech fingerprinting (BuiltWith)**, plus **(c) public repos**. Anything not listed is **not verifiably public**.
