## Question

Which one of these models do I want? Quen 3.6 maybe? 

## Answer

I’ll treat “Quen” as Qwen and compare the visible options against your 32 GB RAM limit, MLX local use, coding/chat value, and OOM risk.

## Answer

Mr. White, yes: **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit** is the best default pick from what’s on your screen.

Use it as your **main general model** because it is MLX-native, 4-bit, image-text capable, and built from `Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B`. Hugging Face lists it around **20.4 GB**, so it fits your 32 GB Mac, but it is memory-tight. citeturn865090view0

My practical recommendation:

| Use case | Pick |
|---|---|
| **General assistant / chat / broad reasoning** | **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit** |
| **Deep text reasoning / planning** | **Qwen3.5-27B-Claude-4.6-Opus-Distilled-MLX-4bit** |
| **Coding agent / Codex / OpenCode / Pi** | **Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-MLX-4bit** |

Your already-installed **Qwen3.5-27B-Claude-4.6-Opus-Distilled** is also a strong option. Its model card says the 4-bit MLX version is about **14 GB**, optimized for Apple Silicon, and recommended for 32 GB+ Macs, which makes it safer than Qwen3.6 when you want more memory headroom. citeturn865090view2

For coding specifically, I would download **lmstudio-community/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-MLX-4bit**. Its card describes it as a 4-bit MLX quantized Qwen coder model optimized for Apple Silicon. citeturn865090view1

Avoid the **Qwen3-Coder-Next** models shown there; the 4-bit one is **41.8 GB** on your page, which is too large for your 32 GB setup.

Bottom line: **select Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit as your main model. Keep Qwen3.5 Claude-distilled for reasoning. Add Qwen3-Coder-30B only if you’re using local coding agents heavily.**

## Question

No, there's Quen 3.6-35B-A3B-4-bit, which only is, I believe, oh no, that one is 20 gigabytes. Wait, I think there's another one. Here you go. Wait. Wait a minute. Downloader. Wait a minute, let's see. Well, there's this, there's this MLX community Quen 3.6-27B-Optic-Q-4-bit that is only 15.3 gigabytes. It's got 8.5 thousand downloads.

## Answer

I’ll compare the 15.3 GB 27B OptiQ and 20 GB 35B A3B options for your 32 GB Mac, focusing on capability versus smoother local operation.

## Answer

Mr. White, **yes — that 27B OptiQ one is probably the better practical pick for your Mac**.

Correct name: **mlx-community/Qwen3.6-27B-OptiQ-4bit**.

I’d rank them like this:

| Model | Pick it when | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| **Qwen3.6-27B-OptiQ-4bit** | You want the best **text-only daily driver** with more RAM headroom | Lower download count, no vision/audio stack |
| **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit** | You want **image + text** support and the more popular model | Heavier at ~20.4 GB, less KV/cache headroom |

The 27B OptiQ model card says it is a mixed-precision MLX quant of **Qwen3.6-27B**, using layer sensitivity to keep some layers at 8-bit and others at 4-bit at about **4.5 BPW**, aiming for higher quality at the same average weight size. It also says this release ships the **language stack only**, with multimodal components stripped to reduce size and leave more RAM for KV cache and LoRA. citeturn311495view0

The 35B-A3B model is different: Hugging Face lists it as **Image-Text-to-Text**, converted with `mlx-vlm`, and about **20.4 GB**. It has far more downloads, around **101,928/month**, compared with **8,501/month** for the 27B OptiQ model. citeturn311495view1turn311495view0

My call:

**Download Qwen3.6-27B-OptiQ-4bit if you want a fast, stable local text/coding/chat model on 32 GB.**

Keep **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit** only if you specifically care about image understanding or want the more battle-tested popular option.

For your setup, I’d use:

**Main text model:** `Qwen3.6-27B-OptiQ-4bit`  
**Vision/image model:** `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit`  
**Coding-specific model:** `Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-MLX-4bit` if you need a separate coder model.

## Question

Is OpenCLAW better than Hermes Agent for us? And is Gamma4 a better model than this, or is this the model?

## Answer

I’ll separate the agent framework question from the model question, then compare OpenCLAW, Hermes Agent, and Gemma/Gamma 4 against your 32 GB Mac oMLX setup.

## Answer

Mr. White, for **our setup**, I would use:

**Agent shell:** OpenClaw  
**Main model:** `Qwen3.6-27B-OptiQ-4bit`  
**Backup / vision model:** `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit`  
**Skip Gemma 4 for now unless you specifically want to test it.**

OpenClaw vs Hermes Agent:

| Tool | My call | Why |
|---|---:|---|
| **OpenClaw** | **Use this first** | Better fit for local oMLX + messaging + coding workflows. It already appears in your oMLX dashboard, supports tool profiles, and is built around local personal-assistant operation. OpenClaw’s own README describes it as a local, fast, always-on personal assistant across WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, iMessage, etc. citeturn887275view1 |
| **Hermes Agent** | Use later / evaluate separately | More ambitious persistent-memory agent. It has self-improving skills, long-term memory, scheduled automations, subagents, and can run on a VPS/cloud backend. That is powerful, but it is more of a full agent platform than the immediate oMLX-integrated choice. citeturn582338view0 |

For OpenClaw, I’d start with **tools profile: Coding**. OpenClaw’s docs say `coding` includes filesystem, runtime, web, sessions, memory, cron, and media tools; `full` removes restrictions. Use `full` only once you trust the setup. citeturn887275view0

On the model question: it’s **Gemma 4**, not Gamma 4. Gemma 4 is impressive; Google says the 26B/31B models are designed for reasoning, coding assistants, agentic workflows, function calling, long context, and multimodal use. citeturn402847view4

For **your use case**, Qwen3.6-27B is still the model I’d pick. Qwen’s own model card directly compares Qwen3.6-27B against Gemma4-31B and shows Qwen3.6-27B ahead on coding/agent benchmarks: SWE-bench Verified **77.2 vs 52.0**, SWE-bench Pro **53.5 vs 35.7**, Terminal-Bench **59.3 vs 42.9**, Claw-Eval Avg **72.4 vs 48.5**, and LiveCodeBench **83.9 vs 80.0**. citeturn958236view1

The exact model I’d download/use:

```text
mlx-community/Qwen3.6-27B-OptiQ-4bit
```

Reason: it is a 27B Qwen3.6 model in MLX, optimized for Apple Silicon with OptiQ mixed-precision quantization. The model card says OptiQ keeps sensitive layers at 8-bit and robust layers at 4-bit at about the same average weight size, and the release strips unused multimodal components to leave more RAM for KV cache and LoRA. citeturn402847view7

Bottom line:

**OpenClaw + Qwen3.6-27B-OptiQ-4bit is the setup.**

Gemma 4 is worth testing later, especially the `gemma-4-26B-A4B` or `gemma-4-31B` variants, but I would not make it the default over Qwen3.6 for coding agents right now.
