## Question

Not gonna lie, I just learned what denormalization is in the context of databases and stuff, through a chat with one of our AI agents, suggesting that if our tables start blowing up, we should do that on our audience out of Linux table that identifies all of our users. I'm curious, LinkinBio product identifies every single user, shows you their LTV, shows you where they're from, what device they're on, where they came from, referrers, and all that kind of shit. We were running a perf loop to try and get it to pass the Gmail test, and we did some optimizations to the skeleton loaders and stuff and progressive loading to make it appear fast. Did some caching so it's fast on the second visit, but the first visit hits a slow database call, and it was suggesting that that could be resolved with denormalization, but it would be an over-optimization pre-launch. And I'm wondering about that. Is that a thing that you think, like, is that a situation where using denormalization in the context wo

## Answer

I’m pulling current Neon and Vercel pricing/limits first, then I’ll map that to your user-table/dashboard pattern and estimate when denormalization helps versus when it just adds write cost.

## Answer

I have the pricing primitives. The key thing I’m checking now is whether a frequent refresh job would materially raise Neon compute by keeping the database warm, because that is the real place denormalization can accidentally cost you.

## Answer

Mr. White, yes — denormalization can help for the page you described. It helps when that audience view is assembling each row from multiple joins, aggregations, or repeated lookups for LTV, referrer, device, geo, and related rollups. It does **not** fix a cold database wake-up by itself. Neon scales idle computes to zero after 5 minutes and then reactivates them on the next query, so if the first-hit slowness is mainly wake-up latency, the root cause is different. citeturn878057view2turn968719view0

For your stack, the cron itself is usually not the thing that blows up cost. Vercel Cron just invokes a Vercel Function. On Vercel, cron jobs are available on all plans, Hobby is limited to once per day, and Pro/Enterprise can run once per minute. Functions on Fluid Compute are billed on active CPU, provisioned memory, and invocations; Vercel’s docs show the first 1,000,000 invocations included, and extra invocations at $0.60 per million. In San Francisco, Fluid Compute is listed at $0.177 per CPU-hour and $0.0147 per GB-hour, and the default function size is 2 GB / 1 vCPU. citeturn292179view2turn671012view0turn524722view0turn524722view2

Neon is the place where a refresh job can become meaningfully expensive. Neon bills compute in CU-hours, with Launch at $0.106/CU-hour and Scale at $0.222/CU-hour. Storage is $0.35/GB-month, and PITR / instant-restore history is $0.20/GB-month. Neon’s own cost guidance says scheduled jobs can prevent scale-to-zero and keep compute active 24/7. citeturn292179view0turn292179view1turn968719view0

Here is the simple model:

`monthly Neon cost ≈ average CU × active hours × CU-hour rate`

If your refresh runs **every minute**, that is less than Neon’s 5-minute idle window, so the database can stay warm continuously. Using Neon’s 0.25 CU minimum-size example over a ~750-hour month, that is about **187.5 CU-hours/month**, which works out to about **$19.88/month on Launch** or **$41.63/month on Scale** even before extra scaling, storage, or write churn. On the Vercel side, **43,200 cron runs/month** only adds about **$0.026/month** in invocation charges. A 2 GB function alive for 2 seconds per run in SFO is about **$0.71/month** in memory charges, and 100 ms of active CPU per run is about **$0.21/month**. So the Vercel cron bill is tiny; the Neon “never gets to sleep” effect is the real risk. citeturn878057view2turn331093calculator0turn331093calculator1turn331093calculator2turn331093calculator3turn331093calculator4turn671012view0turn292179view0

If your refresh runs **every 10 minutes** and the job finishes quickly, Neon can usually scale back down between runs. At Launch pricing, a job that does about **10 seconds** of DB work every 10 minutes is only about **$0.32/month** of Neon compute; **30 seconds** every 10 minutes is about **$0.95/month**. Hourly or half-hourly jobs are cheaper still. In that pattern, cron cost is basically noise. citeturn833324calculator0turn833324calculator1turn833324cal

## Question

We already disabled scale zero on production so that we avoid cold start problems so that is our is already a

## Answer

That changes the cost picture materially. I’m verifying Neon’s current always-on compute and storage billing so I can separate “already paying for warm prod” from the extra write overhead a denormalized table would add.

## Answer

Then the main cost risk I flagged is already baked in.

If production compute is already always active, a cron job does **not** add a new “keep Neon awake” tax. Paid Neon projects can disable scale-to-zero so compute stays active, and compute is billed in CU-hours while it runs. citeturn521990search0turn521990search4turn521990search8

At that point, denormalization is mostly a trade between:
- lower read cost and faster page loads for the audience screen,
- versus extra write work, extra storage, and refresh complexity. Neon also calls out storage/PITR costs and write-heavy patterns as cost drivers, so the question becomes how much churn your refresh creates, not whether cron itself exists. citeturn521990search10turn521990search4

So for your case, the answer is: **yes, denormalization can help, and no, the cron itself is unlikely to jack up costs much if prod is already warm**. The part that can raise cost is a **heavy refresh pattern**:
- rebuilding the whole audience table frequently,
- updating every row whether it changed or not,
- or running enough background work to force you onto a larger compute size. Neon explicitly advises sizing compute to your working set, because undersizing hurts performance and oversizing wastes money. citeturn521990search10turn521990search12

Vercel’s side is usually minor. Cron jobs just invoke Vercel Functions, and function pricing is based on invocations, active CPU, and provisioned memory. That means a lightweight refresh endpoint is usually cheap relative to database work. citeturn521990search1turn521990search3turn521990search13

The practical version:
1. If the audience page is slow because it joins a lot of tables and computes LTV/referrer/device/geo on demand, denormalizing a **read model** for that page is reasonable.
2. Do **incremental updates**, not full-table rebuilds.
3. Refresh on writes or on a coarse schedule like every 5–15 minutes unless you truly need near-real-time.
4. Measure whether the denormalized table lets you stay on the same Neon compute size. That is the cleanest cost test.

A good launch-stage pattern is a single `audience_profile_snapshot` table with columns like:
`user_id, ltv_cents, country, device_type, first_referrer, last_referrer, last_seen_at, visit_count, updated_at`

Then update only users whose underlying events changed since the last run. That usually gives most of the speedup without turning background maintenance into a tax.

If you want, I’ll map this into a concrete Neon/Postgres implementation with the exact SQL shape and when I’d choose trigger-based updates vs scheduled batch updates.
