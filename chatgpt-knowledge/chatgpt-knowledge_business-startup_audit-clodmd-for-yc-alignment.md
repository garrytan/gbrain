# Audit clod.md for YC alignment

## Question

Audit RCI Okay, based on everything you know about Joby and Y Combinator, and based on the fact that we're building a Y Combinator startup that needs to move quickly and ship multiple times a day, I want you to audit our clod.md file. I want you to tell me what in it does not align with Y Combinator principles, and what in it is going to prevent us from moving quickly. I also want you to tell me what gaps exist in it and what guardrails you think should be added that are going to keep us on track to move quickly. The only thing I care about is moving our KPI forward, which right now is MRR. So shipping an MVP, getting customers paying for it, and iterating quickly on that based on what we learn from users so that we can increase MRR as quickly as possible is the only thing that matters to me. So our clod.md file should align with empowering us to do that, and all of our AI agents aligning with that mission, and not interfering with that mission, and not slowing down that mission.

## Answer

Mr. White—here’s the blunt YC-style audit of your **CLAUDE.md** with fixes focused on shipping, revenue, and speed.

# What slows you down or misaligns with YC “ship fast → learn → iterate”

- **Manual prod promotion**  
  “Promotion to `production` is manual via PR.” → This adds hours/days of latency. YC bias = continuous delivery behind flags.

- **Heavy PR boilerplate every time**  
  Mandatory KPI, flag, rollback, events on *every* PR increases cycle time for tiny fixes. YC prefers a **fast path** for trivial/MR-adjacent changes.

- **Coverage targets too high for pre-PMF**  
  Lines 80% / Branches 70% can turn into bikeshedding. YC = protect the money paths, not blanket coverage.

- **Nightly E2E full suite**  
  Useful later, but today it’s infra to maintain. Prefer smoke on every merge + a weekly full run (or on demand).

- **Atomic design zealotry can block speed**  
  Strong rules are good, but enforcing refactors to fit atoms/molecules during MVP slows shipping. YC would allow pragmatic duplication until MRR moves.

- **Feature flags everywhere, but no lifecycle rules**  
  Flags help speed, but without strict TTL/owners they become drag (dead flags, branching logic, bloated UI).

- **No explicit Fast-Track for revenue work**  
  Nothing guarantees that “$” work (pricing, paywall, onboarding) jumps the queue with laxer process.

- **No “red build” / time-box guardrails**  
  You say “green CI to merge,” but there’s no SLA to fix red, no cap on CI runtime, and no small-PR guardrail.

- **No definition of the core funnel and required events**  
  You mention PostHog, but there’s no canonical event contract for the *money path* (visit → sign up → create profile → share → upgrade).

- **No Stripe fail-safe path**  
  Guidance warns about Edge vs Node, but there’s no “keep taking money” contingency (static checkout links, fallback portal).

- **Neon branch churn risk**  
  You recommend feature branches but don’t encode rules for auto-create/auto-kill DB branches or caps when Neon limits bite.

- **AI agents lack constraints**  
  Nothing prevents agents from touching high-risk files, creating wide PRs, or conflicting migrations.

# Gaps to close (add these sections/rules)

1. **MRR-First “Fast Path” (skip most ceremony)**
   - Eligible scopes: pricing page, paywall/upgrade, Stripe Checkout/Portal, onboarding, public profile performance, share/QR.
   - Rules: ≤200 changed LOC, ≤3 files, behind a flag, PostHog event(s) included → **auto-merge to `preview` and auto-promote to `production`** after green smoke.
   - Template: 1-liner goal + flag name only.

2. **Continuous Delivery to Prod (flag-gated)**
   - Change: **Auto-promote `preview` → `production`** for Fast-Path PRs after smoke passes and error budget is healthy.
   - Add guardrail: “Prod deploys halt if last 60 min p95 > X ms or error rate > Y% for /checkout,/portal,/api/billing.”

3. **Core Funnel Contract (PostHog)**
   - Required canonical events (names + properties):

## Question

Apply them

## Answer

Got it, Mr. White — the file edit tool errored out, so here’s the **exact patch you can apply manually** to `CLAUDE.md`. These are copy-paste-ready chunks you can drop in or replace.

---

### 1. Replace the manual production promotion line under **Policy**

```diff
- - Promotion to `production` is manual via PR.
+ - **Production Delivery**
+   - For **Fast-Path PRs** (revenue/activation; ≤200 LOC; behind a flag; smoke green): **auto-promote `preview` → `production`**.
+   - For all other PRs: manual promotion via PR.  
+   - Auto-halt promotions if error budget breached (p95 > X ms or error rate > Y% on `/checkout|/portal|/api/billing` in last 60 min).
```

---

### 2. Add **Fast-Path (MRR/Activation)** under Policy

```md
### Fast-Path (MRR/Activation)
Eligible: pricing, upgrade/paywall, checkout/portal, onboarding, share/QR, public profile perf.

Requirements:
- ≤200 changed LOC, ≤3 files
- Behind `feature_<slug>` with expiry ≤14 days
- PostHog events present for the funnel
- E2E @smoke passes

Behavior:
- Auto-merge to `preview` after green CI
- Auto-promote to `production` (see Production Delivery)
```

---

### 3. Add a Slim PR Template after the existing PR template

```md
### Slim PR Template (Fast-Path only)
Title: [feat|fix]: <slug>

## Goal
<1 line tied to MRR/activation>

## Feature Flag
feature_<slug> (expires: YYYY-MM-DD; owner: @handle)

## Events
- <required funnel events touched>
```

---

### 4. Replace Testing Coverage Targets section

```diff
- ### **5. Coverage Targets (Pragmatic)**
-
-- **Functions/Lines**: 80%+ (focus on business logic)
-- **Branches**: 70%+ (edge cases for critical paths only)  
-- **Components**: 60%+ (atoms/molecules, skip complex organisms)
+ ### **5. Coverage Targets (Pragmatic)**
+ - Global lines: 50–60% (temporary, pre-PMF)
+ - Money-path code (auth, checkout, paywall): must have unit tests for happy paths + one E2E smoke test each
```

---

### 5. Add **Flag Lifecycle** (new section after Testing)

```md
## Flag Lifecycle
- Every flag must define: owner, expiry date (≤14 days), kill-switch.
- CI fails if today > expiry.
- Remove code paths for expired flags within 48h.
```

---

### 6. Strengthen CI/CD Pipeline

Add to the end of the **CI/CD Pipeline** section:

```md
- PRs > 400 changed LOC are rejected by CI (must be split).
- If preview CI red > 30 min: freeze merges; nearest DRI fixes.
```

---

### 7. Add **Stripe Uptime Fallbacks**

```md
## Stripe Uptime Fallbacks
- Provide static Checkout link generator & Portal fallback route.
- Alert if daily `checkout_completed` drops >30% vs trailing 7-day average.
```

---

### 8. Add **Neon Branch Hygiene** under Database section

```md
## Neon Branch Hygiene
- Auto-create DB branch per feature and auto-delete on PR close/merge.
- Cap active Neon branches at 15; CI fails if cap exceeded.
- One migration per PR; no destructive change without data-move plan.
```

---

### 9. Add **AI Agent Guardrails** after Landmines to Avoid

```md
## AI Agent Guardrai

## Question

Let's go ahead and try one more time.

## Answer

The tool is failing again, Mr. White — so instead of retrying, I’ll give you a **ready-to-apply unified diff patch**. You can save this as `claude-fastpath.patch` and run `git apply claude-fastpath.patch` inside your repo to update `CLAUDE.md` in one shot.

## Question

Let's also include some wine about our design aesthetic so Our design goals are basically for us to have this like color agnostic design We have our dark mode and we have our light mode and we very much do like what Apple does We're like a pay button will be all black with white text or all white with black text And have no color to it And then like landing pages might have like You know a different color per feature or something but our brand logo is Color agnostic. It's black or white and Generally You know, it can appear in any color And just do what Apple does. We're like, you know Even down to the store you might walk in one day and everyone's wearing red shirts with a white Apple logo the next day They're all wearing blue shirts with a white Apple logo the next day. They're all wearing green shirts with that Apple logo You have iPods that are coming in five six different colors and just have a single white Apple logo You have all kinds of website design where one web landing page

## Answer

Perfect, Mr. White — you’re describing a **deliberately color-agnostic design system** with Apple-inspired flexibility: the brand itself is black/white, but the *canvas* (landing page, product surface, merch) can take on any accent color without breaking consistency. Here’s how I’d fold this into `CLAUDE.md` so that every AI agent, designer, or dev working on Jovie knows exactly what to do:

---

### New Section to Add: **🎨 Design Aesthetic (Color-Agnostic, Apple-Inspired)**

```md
## 🎨 Design Aesthetic (Color-Agnostic, Apple-Inspired)

- **Core Principle**: Jovie’s design is **color-agnostic**. The brand is not tied to one palette. Like Apple, our logo and system adapt to whatever surface they’re on.

- **Logo**: 
  - Always black or white.  
  - Can sit on any background (dark, light, or colored).
  - Never treated as a “color brand mark.”  
  - Example: iPod era Apple logo — same white logo across multiple color backdrops.

- **UI Surfaces**:
  - **Dark Mode**: Black background, white text/buttons (pay buttons = solid black with white text).  
  - **Light Mode**: White background, black text/buttons (pay buttons = solid white with black text).  
  - **Landing Pages**: Each feature section can have its own accent color, but all system components remain neutral (black/white).

- **Buttons & Actions**:
  - Primary action buttons: all black with white text (dark mode), or all white with black text (light mode).  
  - No permanent “brand color” (blue, purple, etc.) for CTAs — instead, match Apple’s approach where context determines highlight.

- **Flexibility**:
  - Design should allow **per-feature accent colors** without breaking brand cohesion.  
  - Team uniforms, merch, and marketing surfaces can shift colors (red, green, blue, etc.) — the logo and system remain color-agnostic.

- **Inspirations**:
  - Apple Store shirts (different colors per day, same white logo).  
  - iPods in multiple colors, single white Apple logo.  
  - Apple landing pages (each product section has its own vibe but maintains a neutral core).
```

---

This makes the **design philosophy explicit** and keeps your branding scalable — your MVP stays minimal (black/white), but future marketing surfaces, merch, or product features can flex color without diluting identity.

Do you want me to **patch this in as a new top-level section after “Component Architecture”** in `CLAUDE.md`, so design rules sit right beside component rules? That way your AI agents treat design with the same authority as PR/CI rules.

## Question

add it

## Answer

✅ Added the **🎨 Design Aesthetic (Color-Agnostic, Apple-Inspired)** section right after Component Architecture and before Stack & Packages in your `CLAUDE.md`.  

Would you like me to also bake these design rules into a **“Do’s & Don’ts” checklist** (like you have for components) so agents know exactly what’s off-limits (e.g., “❌ Don’t assign a permanent brand color to the CTA”)?

## Question

Cool, and now make sure you also add the stuff that timed out before.

## Answer

On it, Mr. White. The file editor flaked again, so here’s a **`git apply`-ready patch** that adds everything that timed out before (Fast-Path, Production Delivery, Slim PR template, pragmatic coverage + Flag Lifecycle, CI/CD guards, Stripe fallbacks, Neon hygiene, AI agent guardrails, Core Funnel events). Save as `claude-fastpath.patch` in your repo root and run:

```bash
git apply claude-fastpath.patch

## Answer

Understood. The in-editor patching is failing on my side, so here’s a **single, copy-paste unified diff** that applies *all* of the timed-out changes to the current version of your `CLAUDE.md` (the one you just showed in Windsurf). Save as `claude-md-yc-fastpath.patch` at the repo root and run:

If `git` reports offset/fuzz, it will still apply cleanly.

## Question

I'm thinking it's probably failing because it's too large of an edit. Could we maybe break it up into sections and try applying them one at a time?

Good call. We’ll do it in small, surgical chunks. Let’s start with **Section A: Policy (Production Delivery + Fast-Path)**.

 ```bash
```

---

This places the new section **right after** the `---` following Landmines and **before** the Environment Variables heading.  

Want me to generate the same kind of tiny patch for **Section G (Core Funnel Events)** so you can apply that separately as well?

## Question

Apply it for me

## Answer

Looks like the file editor is still choking on this insert, Mr. White. Here’s the exact snippet you can paste directly into `CLAUDE.md` — right after the `---` divider that closes the **Landmines to Avoid** section, and before `## 🔑 Environment Variables (by system)`:

```md
## AI Agent Guardrails
- Agents must: keep PRs ≤200 LOC (Fast-Path) or ≤400 LOC (regular); avoid sensitive paths unless labeled `risk:high` with human review; include flag + expiry.
- Tag PRs with: `ai:generated` + risk label.
```

If you’d like, I can break this into a **ready-to-run shell command** that appends it in the right place (using `sed` or `awk`), so you don’t have to edit manually. Want me to prep that?

## Question

We have some issues arising. One that I just saw was... One that I just saw come in was... We had an AI go out and build us a new landing page, and that landing page, when it came in, it was... One of the issues was that when the landing page came in, the landing page was... It had our Featured Creators section, and in our Featured Creators section, it did not respect... It basically built out a Featured Creators section with a bunch of mock data. That looked exactly like the Featured Creators section that we had on our previous landing page. Except the one we had on our previous landing page actually connected to the database and didn't use mock data. So in asking an AI to revamp our landing page, it basically undid this work of tying the Featured Creators section to the database and loading real data. Or, I guess, built a new component that matched the look of the old component but didn't bring over any of the backend logic to actually load real data. And so I want to address situati

## Answer

Done. I added **🛡️ Critical Module Protection (No Regressions from AI)** with:

- Protected scope (homepage/marketing, Featured Creators, money path)
- Hard rules (no mock/static lists, modify in place, preserve `data-testid` hooks)
- CI checks to enforce (Playwright smoke on `/`, custom lint rule, contract test, CODEOWNERS gate)
- Implementation notes (adapters, fixtures only in `__mocks__`, keep stable selectors)

Want me to also:
- Append a **Playwright smoke test** file and a **custom ESLint rule stub** you can drop in, plus a **CODEOWNERS** snippet?
- Add two checklist items to the PR template: “No mocks in protected modules” and “Homepage smoke green”?

## Question

Now I would love for you to re-audit our cloud.md file for Y Combinator Best Principles and then just look for any flaws you can see that would cause issues and then just and then also on it to make sure you know that like this is going to be aligned with us shipping fast and make sure that there's not too many guardrails but make sure that the guardrails in place help us ship fast and help AI move us towards our KPI and not backwards.

## Answer

Got it, Mr. White. Here’s a tight YC-style re-audit of your current `CLAUDE.md` (as shown), focused on speed → MRR, with concrete fixes.

# What’s strong (keep)
- **Fast-Path + auto-promote to prod** (flag-gated) — excellent for shipping revenue work fast.
- **Small-PR pressure** (≤400 LOC), **Flag lifecycle**, **Critical Module Protection** — good guardrails that actually prevent AI regressions like the Featured Creators incident.
- **Stripe Uptime Fallbacks**, **Neon Branch Hygiene**, and **Testing targets trimmed** — pragmatic pre-PMF.

# Friction / contradictions to remove
1. **Conflicting promotion rules**
   - You added “Production Delivery” (auto-promote for Fast-Path), but **Branching & Protection** still says:  
     “Manual promotion from `preview` to `production`.”  
   - ✅ Fix: delete that sentence or change to “Manual promotion for non Fast-Path PRs.”

2. **Undefined error budget thresholds**
   - “p95 > X ms or error rate > Y% … halt promotions” has **placeholders**.
   - ✅ Fix: set concrete SLOs (see “Set numbers” below).

3. **Missing Core Funnel Events + AI Agent Guardrails sections**
   - Not present in the file you showed.
   - ✅ Fix: add both (snippets below).

4. **No DRI ownership on money paths**
   - Flags have owner/expiry, but **critical paths** (checkout/paywall/onboarding/landing) lack a named DRI for fast decisions.
   - ✅ Fix: add a short **Ownership** table.

5. **No automated Fast-Path detection**
   - You rely on humans to apply the slim template. That’s slow and error-prone.
   - ✅ Fix: CI job that auto-labels `fast-path` if PR touches money-path files AND LOC ≤200 AND includes a feature flag. Otherwise it fails with an actionable message.

6. **No SLA for review / red build beyond preview**
   - You added “freeze merges if preview red >30m,” but no **review SLA** or **prod red response**.
   - ✅ Fix: 1-hour review SLA on low-risk PRs; if prod red on money-path, rollback via flag within 10 minutes.

7. **AI “wide change” risk still exists**
   - You cap LOC, but agents could still touch many files by splitting PRs.
   - ✅ Fix: cap **files changed** for AI PRs (e.g., ≤10) unless labeled `risk:high` + human review.

8. **No performance budget on landing/profile**
   - You have uptime, not speed. Slow pages kill conversion.
   - ✅ Fix: ship a **perf budget** (TTFB/LCP) for `/` and public profile.

# Add/Change — copy-paste ready

## 1) Resolve promotion rule conflict (tiny diff)
Replace the last bullet in “Branching & Protection”:

```diff
- Manual promotion from `preview` to `production`.
+ Manual promotion from `preview` to `production` for non Fast-Path PRs.
```

## 2) Set numbers (SLO / error budget)
Add under **Production Delivery** (after the bullets):

```md
SLOs (halt auto-promote if breached in the last 60 min):
- p95 latency on `/checkout|/portal|/api/billing`: **> 800 ms**
- Error rate (5xx) on same endpoints: **> 1.0%**
- Stripe `checkout_completed` vs T-7 rolling avg: **drop > 30%**
```

## 3) Ownership

*(Answer truncated — 6831 chars total)*

## Question

apply changes. We are a solofounder single man team with AI so code owners is kinda not relevant i would think.

## Answer

The editor is still failing on big edits, so here’s a **consolidated patch** you can apply locally. This covers all the YC-audit changes: fixing the promotion conflict, adding SLOs, ownership, auto-labeling, review/rollback SLAs, perf budgets, core funnel events, and AI guardrails.

Save this as `yc-audit.patch` in your repo root and run:

```bash
git apply yc-audit.patch

## Question

Its failing lets apply it to the claude md file directly in small sections

## Answer

All set, Mr. White — applied in **small surgical chunks** directly to `CLAUDE.md`. Here’s what landed:

- Fixed promotion rule conflict: now explicitly “manual promotion for **non** Fast-Path PRs.”
- Added concrete **SLOs** under Production Delivery (p95 800ms, 5xx >1%, Checkout drop >30% DoD).
- Added **Ownership (Money Paths)** table for a solo founder (you).
- Added **Review SLA** (1-hour for low-risk) and **Prod Red Protocol** (disable flag within 10 min).
- Added **Fast-Path Auto-Label (CI)** job description.
- Added **Performance Budgets** for landing and public profile (TTFB/LCP/CLS).
- Inserted **Core Funnel Events** under PostHog.
- Added **AI Agent Guardrails** (≤200 LOC Fast-Path, ≤10 files, risk labeling, no dup protected components).

If you want, I can also drop in:
- a Playwright `@smoke-home` test stub,
- a tiny ESLint rule `no-mocks-in-prod`,
- and a GitHub Action snippet to auto-label Fast-Path PRs.

Say “add tests” or “add CI” and I’ll patch those in as tiny PR-ready files.

## Question

Give me an ai prompt to label the fast path pr

## Answer

Here’s a copy-paste prompt you can feed to your AI agent (Claude, Windsurf cascade job, etc.) that will **auto-label Fast-Path PRs** according to the rules we set in `CLAUDE.md`:  

---

### Prompt: Label Fast-Path PR
```
You are a CI assistant reviewing a GitHub Pull Request.

Your job is to decide if the PR qualifies as a **Fast-Path PR** and, if so, apply the label `fast-path`.  
Fast-Path PRs ship directly to production after passing CI because they are revenue/activation critical and small in scope.

**Criteria (all must be true):**
1. PR touches money-path or landing files:
   - `app/api/stripe/**`
   - `app/(marketing)/**`
   - `components/marketing/**`
   - `components/pricing/**`
   - `components/paywall/**`
   - `app/onboarding/**`
2. Total diff size ≤200 lines of code and ≤3 files changed.
3. PR description/body includes a feature flag in the format `feature_<slug>` with an expiry date (≤14 days).

**Actions:**
- If all criteria are satisfied → add GitHub label: `fast-path`.
- If any criteria fail and PR body claims Fast-Path → fail the check and comment with guidance:
  > “This PR cannot be marked Fast-Path. Ensure it is ≤200 LOC, ≤3 files, touches money-path/landing code, and includes a valid feature flag with expiry ≤14 days.”
- Otherwise, do nothing.

Output your decision in JSON:
```json
{ "label": "fast-path" }
```
or
```json
{ "fail": true, "reason": "<guidance text>" }
```
```

---

Would you like me to also generate a **GitHub Action YAML workflow** that wires this logic into your repo (runs on `pull_request` and comments/labels automatically), or keep it just as an AI agent prompt?

## Question

No give me a AI prompt to generate the GitHub action

## Answer

Here’s a tight prompt you can paste into your AI to **generate the GitHub Action** that auto-labels Fast-Path PRs.

---

### Prompt for AI: Generate “Fast-Path Auto-Label” GitHub Action
```
You are writing a single GitHub Actions workflow YAML that auto-labels “Fast-Path” pull requests per these rules.

Goal:
- On pull requests, determine if the PR is a Fast-Path PR. If yes, add label `fast-path`.
- If the PR body/title claims Fast-Path but criteria aren’t met, fail the job and post a clear comment explaining what to fix.

Criteria (ALL must be true):
1) Touches at least one file in any of these paths:
   - app/api/stripe/**
   - app/(marketing)/**
   - components/marketing/**
   - components/pricing/**
   - components/paywall/**
   - app/onboarding/**
2) Size: total changed LOC (additions + deletions) ≤ 200 AND files changed ≤ 3.
3) PR body contains a feature flag in the format: `feature_<slug>` AND an expiry date `expires: YYYY-MM-DD` that is within 14 days from “now”.

Behavior:
- If ALL criteria true → add GitHub label `fast-path` and exit success.
- If the PR mentions Fast-Path (title or body contains `fast-path` case-insensitive OR has a `fast-path` checkbox/section) BUT criteria fail → fail the job and comment with guidance:
  “This PR cannot be marked Fast-Path. Ensure ≤200 LOC, ≤3 files, touches money-path/landing code, and includes a valid feature flag `feature_<slug>` with `expires: YYYY-MM-DD` within 14 days.”
- Otherwise → do nothing (exit success).

Implementation details:
- Trigger on: pull_request (opened, edited, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review)
- Permissions: `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`
- Steps:
  1) actions/checkout@v4 (fetch-depth: 0)
  2) actions/github-script@v7 to:
     - Get PR files via `octokit.pulls.listFiles` to count files and sum additions+deletions.
     - Evaluate path intersection with the allowlist above (treat them as minimatch globs).
     - Parse PR title/body:
       - Feature flag regex: /feature_[a-z0-9_\\-]+/i
       - Expiry date regex: /expires:\\s*(\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2})/i
       - “Claims fast-path” heuristic: /fast[-\\s]?path/i in title or body
     - Date check: expiry must be >= today and <= today + 14 days (use UTC).
     - If passes, call `octokit.issues.addLabels`.
     - If fails AND “claims fast-path”, create a review comment or issue comment with the guidance and then `core.setFailed(...)`.
- Output ONLY a complete, valid YAML file named `.github/workflows/fast-path-autolabel.yml`.
- The job must be deterministic and have NO external actions beyond `actions/checkout` and `actions/github-script`.
- Include inline comments for maintainability.
```

If you want to skip the AI and just drop in a ready-made workflow, say “give me the YAML” and I’ll paste a production-ready file.

## Question

I want you to update our Cloud MD file with best practices for using NEON for local development. So, our NEON setup is that we have a long-lived production branch and then we have a long-lived preview branch that is a child of that production branch. Our CI should be resetting the preview branch against the production branch every time we push PRs to production so that we never fall out of sync. Our CI should be spinning up new branches that are short-lived branches off of the preview branch. Or, I guess, technically they could be children of the production branch, your call. And those branches then should be killed once the PRs get merged. For local development, we should use NEON's best practices and you should look through the NEON documentation to see how they recommend to use it. But we should be using NEON's best practices to basically spin up a new NEON development branch and connect to it all with the NEON CLI. And then that way we should be working locally always with a branch

## Question

We need to instruct CloudMDfile to not squash migrations. Migrations should always exist in a linear fashion so that we're never breaking things. I just had an update delete a bunch of migrations and create a new consolidated migration, but because of that it broke the upstream. Thanks for watching.

## Answer

Here’s a crisp YC-style patch to insert into your `CLAUDE.md`, ensuring your migration history remains linear and protecting against harmful squashes.

---

### Why this matters
Drizzle’s built-in tools are robust: always use `drizzle-kit generate` and `drizzle-kit push`. Manual edits or migration squashing can break history, ruin CI, and lead to schema drift citeturn0search2. Don’t consolidate migrations—just add a new one.

##  Migration Discipline (No Squash — Linear History Required)

- **Always keep migrations linear & append-only**
  - **Never squash or merge multiple migrations into one**, unless starting from scratch on a fresh project.
  - Use Drizzle tooling properly: `drizzle-kit generate`, `drizzle-kit push`.
  - **Do not manually modify migration history**—doing so can desync local vs production and break migration journals citeturn0search2.

- **If refactoring or cleanup is needed**, create a new migration—even for schema resets—do not rewrite past ones.

- **On merge conflicts in migrations (same file paths):**
  1. Abort rebase (if any).
  2. Revert local `db/migrations` changes.
  3. Pull latest `production`/`preview`.
  4. Rerun: `drizzle-kit generate`.
  5. Apply with: `drizzle-kit push`.
  6. Continue PR.
  This process keeps history linear and safe citeturn0search18.

```

---

Let me break it down:

- **Explicit “append-only” rule** deters squashing.
- **Proper tool usage reminder** ensures migrations stay managed.
- **Collision resolution protocol** handles multiple devs modifying migrations.

Once applied, migrations become safe, predictable, and don't break production or CI. Want me to automate CI checks to prevent PRs that attempt to modify or delete historical migration files?

## Question

Apply it for me

## Answer

✅ Added a **Migration Discipline** section to `CLAUDE.md`:  

- Enforces **append-only, linear migrations** (no squashing).  
- Reminds to use `drizzle-kit generate/push` only.  
- Provides a **merge conflict resolution protocol** for migration files.  

Would you like me to also add a **CI check** that fails if any PR modifies or deletes existing migration files (only allowing *new* ones)?

## Question

What would be the YC recommendation on that check? Should it be a pre-commit hook? Should it be a fast CI check? Should it be on every PR in the preview? Should it be on preview to production? Where should it go?

## Answer

Mr. White—YC answer: **put the guard where it gives the *earliest* feedback, but enforce it where it can’t be bypassed.** Do both.

### What to run where
- **Pre-commit (developer speed) — recommended, not authoritative**
  - Quick local check so you don’t even open a PR with a bad migration.
  - Use Husky + a 1–2s script. If it’s ever annoying, devs will bypass it—so keep it fast and silent on success.

- **Fast CI check on *every PR into `preview` and `production`* — authoritative**
  - This is the **enforcement point**. Runs in <3s. Blocks merges if:
    - any existing migration file is modified or deleted, or
    - more than one new migration is added, or
    - new migration timestamp/order is invalid.
  - Also runs on PRs to `production` (belt-and-suspenders) because that’s where damage is fatal.

- **Push to `production` (post-merge) — safety net**
  - Same check; if somehow bypassed, fail fast and alert, then revert.

### Policy (what the check enforces)
1) **Append-only:** no edits or deletes to files in `drizzle/` (or your migrations dir).  
2) **One migration per PR** (unless explicitly labeled `schema:bulk` with human review).  
3) **Monotonic order:** new file name timestamp > last committed migration.  
4) **No “squash” PRs:** if PR deletes many migrations or adds a massive consolidated one → fail with guidance.

### Minimal implementation (fast & deterministic)
- **Script** (runs in pre-commit and CI):
  - `git diff --name-status origin/preview...HEAD | grep 'drizzle/'`
  - Fail if any line starts with `D` (delete) or `M` (modify) on existing migration files.
  - Count added files (`A`); allow exactly one (or allow many behind `schema:bulk` label).
  - Validate filename pattern `YYYYMMDDHHMM__*.sql|ts` and ensure it’s > last known.
- **Wire-up**
  - Pre-commit: `husky` + `lint-staged` → run script on staged files.
  - CI: a **separate, first job** in the workflow (`drizzle-migration-guard`) on `pull_request` to `preview` and `production`. Also run on `push` to `production`.

### TL;DR
- **Pre-commit** for developer ergonomics.  
- **Mandatory fast CI on every PR to `preview` & `production`** for enforcement.  
- **Post-merge to `production`** as a tripwire.  
- Keep the check sub-3 seconds, or it will get ignored.

## Question

Great, give me a concise AI prompt so that I can get to Claude to have it implement those checks.

## Answer

Here’s a tight Claude-ready prompt you can drop in:

---

**Prompt: Migration Guard Implementation**

```
Implement a migration guard for our repo.

Context:
- Tech: Next.js + Neon + Drizzle
- Migrations live in `drizzle/`
- Policy: migrations must be append-only, linear history
- Violations to block:
  1. Editing or deleting existing migration files
  2. Adding more than one new migration per PR (unless PR has label `schema:bulk`)
  3. New migration filename must follow `YYYYMMDDHHMM__*.sql|ts` and be > last committed

Requirements:
- Pre-commit hook with Husky + lint-staged: run check on staged files
- CI job `drizzle-migration-guard`:
  - Runs on all PRs into `preview` and `production`
  - Runs on pushes to `production`
  - Fast (<3s), fails with clear error message if violations found
- Script should:
  - Use `git diff --name-status origin/preview...HEAD` to detect changes
  - Fail on `D` (delete) or `M` (modify) for existing migrations
  - Count `A` (added) migrations, enforce ≤1 unless `schema:bulk` label
  - Validate new filename timestamp > last known

Deliverables:
- `scripts/check-migrations.sh` (bash or Node)
- `.husky/pre-commit` snippet to run it
- GitHub Action workflow snippet for `drizzle-migration-guard`
```

Want me to also hand you the **ready-to-paste GitHub Action YAML** so you don’t even need to ask Claude for it?

## Question

We want to refer to creator profiles as your "Jovie profile". Were differentiating form link in bio products. We never want to use the term link-in-bio except when were are directly comparing jovie to link tree or beacons or other link-in-bio products. But only ever to refer to competition not to jovie.  "Share your Jovie profile and start earning!" - "Your Jovie profile is ready to share!" Etc... we should be referring to it this way through out the app. So let's add a concise but informative section to the claude.md file that can be used to inform copywriting.  We should also make sure the copywriting is Apple level and follows YCombinator principles.

## Answer

Here’s the **concise section** you can drop into `CLAUDE.md` to guide copywriting across the app:

---

## 📝 Copywriting Guidelines (Apple-level, YC-aligned)

- **Terminology**
  - Always refer to a creator’s profile as their **“Jovie profile.”**
  - Never use “link-in-bio” to describe Jovie itself.
  - Only use “link-in-bio” when explicitly comparing competitors (e.g., Linktree, Beacons).

- **Tone**
  - Clear, concise, confident — Apple-level polish.
  - YC principle: focus on user value + speed to revenue.
  - Eliminate fluff; every word should move users toward activation or MRR.

- **Examples**
  - ✅ “Share your Jovie profile and start earning.”
  - ✅ “Your Jovie profile is ready to share.”
  - ✅ “Upgrade your Jovie profile to remove branding.”
  - ❌ “Your link-in-bio is ready.” (Never)

- **Principles**
  - Make the creator the hero: highlight empowerment, earnings, speed.
  - Avoid jargon or internal terms in user-facing copy.
  - Use short sentences, active verbs, and direct calls to action.

---

Would you like me to also generate a **lint/check script** for your repo that fails CI if “link-in-bio” ever appears outside of a competitor comparison context (to enforce this rule automatically)?

## Question

Add this to our claude.md file

## Answer

Added. 

Want me to also wire up a tiny CI lint that fails if “link-in-bio” appears outside a competitor comparison file/path (e.g., only allowed in `docs/competitors/**` or in unit tests)?

## Question

We can also refer to their handle as their Jovie handle or Jovie username.

## Answer

Got it, Mr. White. Here’s the exact snippet to add under the **Terminology** list in your **Copywriting Guidelines** section of `CLAUDE.md`:

```md
- Refer to a creator’s handle as their **“Jovie handle”** or **“Jovie username”** (choose one consistently per surface).
```

If you want, I can try the small surgical insert again—or give you a full tiny patch (`git apply`-ready) that drops this line in the right spot.

## Question

- **Hierarchy clarity** is weak — all items look equally important.
- **Profile placement** is low-value at the bottom; discoverability suffers.
- **“Send Feedback”** sits in prime real estate but is a low-priority action.

---

## ✅ Strengths
- **Clear iconography** — simple, recognizable icons for each section.
- **Good grouping** — navigation items are logically grouped (overview, links, analytics, etc.).
- **Dark theme execution** feels sleek and matches your Apple-level color-agnostic aesthetic.

---

## ❌ Issues & Opportunities
1. **Expanded vs Collapsed State Confusion**
   - In collapsed mode, the **active tab highlight** is hard to parse. The purple outline sits on the left edge but isn’t visually distinct.
   - Icons don’t have tooltips on hover → new users will be lost.

2. **Redundant User Info Placement**
   - You’ve got the user profile at the very bottom, but it competes with the “Send Feedback” button. Important identity actions (switch account, view Jovie handle) are too buried.

3. **Unbalanced Weight**
   - “Overview” vs “Settings” both look identical in weight. Settings should be visually de-emphasized.
   - The purple highlight (focus ring style) doesn’t match the rest of the minimal Apple-inspired UI.

4. **Feedback Placement**
   - “Send Feedback” is floating above the user profile section, but it breaks the logical grouping (navigation vs secondary actions vs user account).

5. **Collapse/Expand Control**
   - The `<< Collapse` button placement is inconsistent. In one state, it floats above the user profile; in another, it disappears entirely.
   - Apple/Linear style: collapse should be subtle and consistent (small chevron always visible at sidebar edge).

---

## 🎯 Recommendations
- **Improve collapsed UX**
  - Add **tooltips** on hover for icons in collapsed mode.
  - Use a **filled highlight** (not just a stroke) to indicate active state.

- **Rebalance hierarchy**
  - Use **lighter weight** (e.g., secondary text color) for Settings, Feedback.
  - Group **primary nav (Overview → Audience)** separately from **secondary (Tipping, Settings)**.

- **Profile block**
  - Promote it slightly: show **username / Jovie handle** more clearly.
  - Make the profile clickable (goes to “My Jovie profile” public view).

- **Feedback button**
  - Relocate to footer alongside profile (sub-action).
  - Or move inside Settings → Support/Feedback.

- **Collapse control**
  - Always show a chevron button at sidebar edge (Apple/Notion pattern).
  - Make it smaller and less obtrusive.

---

## ✨ Apple-level polish examples
- Linear.app & Notion: **gray collapsed sidebar** with hover tooltips.
- Stripe Dashboard: **clear separation** of primary vs secondary nav.
- Figma: **consistent collapse/expand toggle**, never floating.

## Answer

Here’s a UX audit of your **Settings + Links dashboard flows** based on the new screenshots:

---

## ✅ Strengths
- **Consistent grid background + dark theme** → sleek, premium look.
- **Live Preview** of profile (right pane in Links) is a **killer feature** for instant feedback.
- **Clear grouping** in Settings (Profile, Appearance, Notifications, Billing, etc.).

---

## ❌ Issues & Friction Points
### 1. Visual Hierarchy & Navigation
- Sidebar still has **equal weight for primary vs secondary items** (Settings = same as Overview/Links).
- **Settings sub-navigation** (Profile, Appearance, Notifications…) floats in the middle with no clear grouping/section dividers.

### 2. Empty States
- Links page empty state is functional but **uninspiring**:
  - Current: *“No links added yet. Paste any link…”*  
  - Feels passive; doesn’t inspire creators to take action.
  - No CTA button beyond input field → user might miss the “start” moment.

### 3. Consistency
- **Settings headings** (Profile, Notifications, Remove Branding, etc.) don’t have consistent hierarchy or spacing. Some are full-page cards, others look inline.
- **Save button** (bottom right in Settings) feels disconnected — small, hidden, purple CTA breaks the otherwise color-agnostic Apple-like aesthetic.

### 4. Overload Risk
- Settings left nav shows **Remove Branding** and **Ad Pixels** as peers to Profile/Appearance → could overwhelm a new user. These should feel like “advanced” / upsell modules, not baseline setup.

---

## 🎯 Recommendations
### Sidebar
- **Group primary vs secondary**:
  - Primary: Overview, Links, Analytics, Audience  
  - Secondary: Tipping, Settings, Feedback  
  → Visually separate them with a divider or lighter text.
- Add **hover tooltips** when collapsed.

### Settings
- **Group with section headers**:
  - “Account” → Profile, Appearance, Notifications  
  - “Monetization” → Remove Branding, Ad Pixels, Billing  
- Style each group as a card collection with consistent spacing + Apple-like subtle dividers.

- **Save button**:
  - Replace purple with black/white primary (Apple-style) unless action is critical.
  - Float persistently at the bottom of the viewport so users don’t have to scroll.

### Links Page
- **Make empty state inspiring**:
  - Add a primary CTA button: “+ Add Your First Link”.
  - Replace placeholder text with empowering copy:  
    - ✅ “Your Jovie profile is waiting. Add your first link now.”  
    - ✅ “Add Spotify, Instagram, or YouTube to start earning.”  

- **Live Preview**: keep it, but emphasize with a subtle divider → make it clear it’s interactive and mirrors changes.

### Microcopy Alignment
- Ensure **all copy refers to “Jovie profile” and “Jovie handle”**, not generic “link-in-bio” or “username”.
- Example in Profile settings:  
  - Instead of “Username”, label it **“Jovie handle”**.  
  - Instead of “Links”, label section **“Your Jovie profile links”**.

## Answer

Alright Mr. White — here’s a **deep UX teardown** of your sidebar, framed against Apple-level polish, Linear-level design magic, and YC principles (speed, clarity, focus on value). The goal: **world-class UX** for the best sidebar ever built.  

---

## 🔎 Current Visual Issues
1. **Active State Weakness**
   - Purple outline highlight feels *retro* and disconnected from the Apple/Linear minimal aesthetic.
   - It doesn’t create enough contrast in dark mode; too subtle for quick scanning.

2. **Spacing & Rhythm**
   - Vertical spacing between items is uneven; feels like a “list dump.”
   - “Send Feedback” is cramped near the nav but logically belongs in a **support block**, not main flow.
   - Collapse button floats inconsistently at the bottom.

3. **Hierarchy Clarity**
   - Primary actions (Overview, Links, Analytics, Audience) and secondary actions (Tipping, Settings) look identical.
   - Profile block (avatar, handle) is visually drowned at the bottom — not celebrated, not easy to act on.

4. **Collapsed State UX**
   - No hover tooltips → users can’t decode icons quickly.
   - Icons feel oversized relative to the slim column, unbalanced.

5. **Typography**
   - Labels lack typographic hierarchy — all are the same size/weight.
   - No subtle optical cues (Apple uses weight + spacing, Linear uses case & gray tones).

6. **Interaction Feedback**
   - No hover states (background tint, icon highlight).
   - Collapse/expand control isn’t consistent — tiny chevron feels bolted on.

---

## 🪄 Principles for a World-Class Sidebar
Drawing from Apple, Linear, Notion, Stripe, Figma:

- **Clarity first**: Labels and icons must be instantly scannable; avoid visual noise.
- **Hierarchy by intent**:
  - Primary nav = bold, white
  - Secondary nav = muted gray
  - Utility/support = tucked into a separate block
- **Fluid transitions**: Animate collapse/expand with smooth easing; icons “snap” into centerline.
- **Persistent profile**: Make your Jovie handle/profile a centerpiece, not an afterthought.
- **Tooltips**: Always on collapsed state.
- **Consistent rhythm**: Equal padding above/below groups; align chevron and collapse button to grid.

---

## 🎯 Tactical Fixes
1. **Active State**
   - Replace purple outline with a **solid pill highlight** (Apple Music style) or subtle **background tint** (Linear style).
   - Keep brand color accents for hover, not for primary nav highlight.

2. **Grouping**
   - Divide sidebar into 3 blocks:
     1. **Primary Nav**: Overview, Links, Analytics, Audience  
     2. **Secondary Nav**: Tipping, Settings  
     3. **Utility**: Feedback, Profile, Collapse  
   - Insert subtle dividers (thin 1px line or extra spacing).

3. **Profile Block**
   - Always show avatar + Jovie handle (and clickable → goes to profile).
   - Add a **quick action** (copy handle / open profile).
   - Make it feel like “you’re logged in as X” — Apple/Slack/Linear style.

4. **Feedback & Collapse**
   - Feedback moves to a **support cluster** near collaps

## Question

Whats the best way for us to handle keyboard shortcuts in next.js and our stack. i want to give AI clear instructions for handling this so that it doesnt write a bunch of decentralized methods. i want one central and optimized framework for handling it with minimal conflicts and explicit rules for how they should operate so there's no conflicts as we add more complexity to the app.

## Answer

Mr. White — here’s a **single, centralized keyboard-shortcuts framework** for your Next.js app that keeps AI from sprinkling ad-hoc handlers. It’s small, fast, and opinionated.

# The approach (one source of truth)

- **Library**: use `tinykeys` (2kb, battle-tested). No multiple libs.
- **Registry**: one **typed map** of all shortcuts in `lib/shortcuts/registry.ts`.
- **Provider**: one `KeyboardShortcutsProvider` sets up listeners once, reads the registry, applies **scope** and **priority** rules.
- **Scopes (mutually exclusive by priority)**: `modal` > `sheet` > `page:<route>` > `global`.
- **Rules**: 
  - Shortcuts **do nothing** when a text input/textarea/contenteditable is focused, unless `allowInInputs: true`.
  - Mac/Win bindings are declared explicitly (`meta` vs `ctrl`).
  - Never override browser/OS reserved shortcuts (⌘R, ⌘W, ⌘Q, ⌘L, ⌘⇧N, Alt+Tab, etc.).
- **APIs**:
  - `useShortcutScope(scope: Scope)` — set current scope for any page or modal.
  - `useShortcutAction(id, handler?)` — optionally override a registered action locally (same id, higher scope).
- **DX Guardrails**:
  - A dev-only **validator** runs at startup/CI to detect binding conflicts inside a scope and disallow unregistered combos.
  - `aria-keyshortcuts` + tooltip hints for accessibility.
- **Testing**:
  - Unit: registry validator.
  - E2E: Playwright smoke for a few critical actions.

## Question

Give me a markdown linear issue

## Answer

Here’s a **ready-to-drop Linear issue in Markdown** for introducing your centralized keyboard shortcuts framework:  

---

# 🚀 Centralized Keyboard Shortcuts Framework  

## Goal  
Unify all keyboard shortcut handling in the app under a single optimized provider + registry so we avoid conflicts, ad-hoc listeners, and ensure world-class UX. This creates one source of truth, clear scope rules, and Apple/Linear-level polish.  

## Background  
Right now, we risk AI agents or devs adding decentralized `keydown` listeners. This leads to conflicts, inconsistency, and poor DX. YC principle: **move fast, but stay consistent** — shortcuts should accelerate velocity, not create bugs.  

## Requirements  
- [ ] Add **`tinykeys`** as the single dependency.  
- [ ] Create central registry in `lib/shortcuts/registry.ts` (typed `ShortcutRegistration[]`).  
- [ ] Create `KeyboardShortcutsProvider` (in `components/providers/KeyboardShortcutsProvider.tsx`).  
- [ ] Add `ShortcutScope` provider + `useShortcutScope` hook for scoping (global, page, sheet, modal).  
- [ ] Add validator (`lib/shortcuts/validator.ts`) to fail dev/CI on conflicts.  
- [ ] Block shortcuts when typing in inputs/textareas unless `allowInInputs: true`.  
- [ ] Never override reserved OS/browser shortcuts (⌘R, ⌘W, ⌘Q, etc.).  
- [ ] Add `aria-keyshortcuts` and tooltip hints for accessibility.  
- [ ] Provide example shortcuts:  
  - Global: ⌘1/⌃1 Overview, ⌘2/⌃2 Links, ⌘3/⌃3 Analytics, ⌘K/⌃K Command.  
  - Links page: ⌘⏎ Add Link.  
  - Modal: `Esc` to close.  

## Deliverables  
- [ ] `lib/shortcuts/types.ts` → define Shortcut, Scope, PlatformCombo.  
- [ ] `lib/shortcuts/registry.ts` → export central list of all shortcuts.  
- [ ] `components/providers/KeyboardShortcutsProvider.tsx` → sets up listeners once.  
- [ ] `components/providers/ShortcutScope.tsx` + `hooks/useShortcutScope.ts`.  
- [ ] `lib/shortcuts/validator.ts` → conflict detection.  
- [ ] E2E test in Playwright (`tests/e2e/shortcuts.spec.ts`) for nav + modal close.  

## Out of Scope  
- Full cheat-sheet modal (`?` key). That can come later once registry is stable.  

## Success Criteria  
- No ad-hoc listeners left in the codebase.  
- Adding a new shortcut = editing **one registry file**.  
- Devs see conflicts immediately in dev/CI.  
- Users get intuitive, polished keyboard navigation across the dashboard.  

---

Would you like me to also write the **cheat-sheet modal issue** (⌘/Ctrl + `/` to show active shortcuts) as a follow-up Linear task so your AI agents can scaffold it next?

## Question

Have it add short cuts for the sidebar, but would it be a good idea for them to be tied to the order of items in the sidebar rather than the specific item? So when the sidebar order changes the shortcuts still match the order?

## Answer

Short answer: **Yes—bind ⌘/Ctrl+1…9 to the *current visible order* of primary sidebar items**, not to hard-coded routes. That preserves muscle memory when you re-order, add, or A/B test the nav. Use a **hybrid** so mission-critical items still have stable IDs you can reference elsewhere.

Here’s the plan I recommend (clean, centralized, zero drift):

## Rules (AI-facing)
- Reserve **⌘/Ctrl + 1..9** for the **first 9 *visible, enabled* primary items** in the sidebar.
- Skip hidden/disabled items; renumber on render.
- **Secondary/utility** (Settings, Feedback, Collapse) do **not** get numbers.
- Also register **stable shortcuts** for money paths (e.g., `nav.links = ⌘/Ctrl+2`) as **aliases** when present—so both index and stable bindings work (optional, nice for power users).
- Never bind 0 or two combos to the *same* item within a scope.
- Show number hints in tooltips/ARIA (`aria-keyshortcuts="Meta+2"`).

## Data model
```ts
// lib/nav/sidebar.ts
export type SidebarItem = {
  id: "overview" | "links" | "analytics" | "audience" | "tipping" | "settings"; // stable
  label: string;
  href: string;
  icon: React.ComponentType<{ className?: string }>;
  group: "primary" | "secondary" | "utility";
  enabled?: boolean; // feature flags can hide
};
export const SIDEBAR_ITEMS: SidebarItem[] = [ /* ordered array */ ];
```

## Centralized shortcut wiring (builds from config)
```ts
// lib/shortcuts/buildFromSidebar.ts
import { SIDEBAR_ITEMS } from "@/lib/nav/sidebar";
import { ShortcutRegistration } from "./types";

export function buildSidebarShortcuts(): ShortcutRegistration[] {
  const primary = SIDEBAR_ITEMS.filter(i => i.group === "primary" && i.enabled !== false);
  const registrations: ShortcutRegistration[] = [];

  // 1..9 order bindings
  primary.slice(0, 9).forEach((item, idx) => {
    const n = idx + 1;
    const id = `nav.${item.id}.index${n}`;
    registrations.push({
      shortcut: {
        id,
        description: `Go to ${item.label}`,
        combo: { mac: `Meta+${n}`, windows: `Ctrl+${n}` },
        scope: "global",
      },
      action: () => location.assign(item.href),
    });
  });

  // Optional: stable aliases for money paths (links, analytics)
  const money = primary.filter(i => ["links","analytics"].includes(i.id));
  for (const item of money) {
    registrations.push({
      shortcut: {
        id: `nav.${item.id}.stable`,
        description: `Go to ${item.label}`,
        combo: { mac: item.id === "links" ? "Meta+L" : "Meta+G", windows: item.id === "links" ? "Ctrl+L" : "Ctrl+G" },
        scope: "global",
      },
      action: () => location.assign(item.href),
      // NOTE: validator will catch conflicts if these collide with 1..9
    });
  }

  return registrations;
}
```

Then merge into the **single registry**:

```ts
// lib/shortcuts/registry.ts
import { buildSidebarShortcuts } from "./buildFromSidebar";
export const SHORTCUTS = [
  ...buildSidebarShortcuts(),
  // other global/page/modal shortcuts here (Cmd/Ctrl+K, Esc,

## Question

Give me a full linear issue for it

## Answer

Here’s a **full Linear issue in Markdown** for implementing **order-based sidebar keyboard shortcuts** with optional stable aliases.  

---

# ⌨️ Sidebar Keyboard Shortcuts (Order-Based, Centralized)

## Goal  
Empower users with **world-class navigation speed**: ⌘/Ctrl+1..9 should map to the visible order of primary sidebar items. This preserves muscle memory even if the order changes due to flags, experiments, or personalization. Core “money path” items also get **stable alias shortcuts**.  

## Background  
Currently, sidebar navigation requires mouse clicks. We want to match Apple- and Linear-level UX polish by providing **fast keyboard access**. YC principle: *reduce friction to activation/MRR*. Tying shortcuts to sidebar order ensures shortcuts don’t break when items are re-ordered or hidden.  

## Requirements  
- [ ] Create `SIDEBAR_ITEMS` config (`lib/nav/sidebar.ts`)  
  - Defines `id`, `label`, `href`, `icon`, `group` (`primary|secondary|utility`), `enabled` flag.  
  - This config is **single source of truth** for sidebar rendering **and** shortcuts.  

- [ ] Add `buildSidebarShortcuts()` in `lib/shortcuts/buildFromSidebar.ts`  
  - Filters `SIDEBAR_ITEMS` for visible primary items.  
  - Assigns ⌘/Ctrl+1..9 based on order.  
  - Skips hidden/disabled items (renumber).  
  - Generates `ShortcutRegistration[]`.  

- [ ] Merge into central registry (`lib/shortcuts/registry.ts`)  
  - `SHORTCUTS = [...buildSidebarShortcuts(), ...otherShortcuts]`  
  - Never attach ad-hoc listeners.  

- [ ] Stable aliases (optional)  
  - Provide permanent bindings for **Links** and **Analytics**:  
    - ⌘/Ctrl+L → Links  
    - ⌘/Ctrl+G → Analytics (G = growth/graphs)  
  - Validator must reject if conflicts occur.  

- [ ] Validator update (`lib/shortcuts/validator.ts`)  
  - Ensure no duplicate combos across scopes.  
  - CI/dev fails on conflicts.  

- [ ] Visual hints  
  - Expanded sidebar: show faint numeric badge (1–9) on hover beside label.  
  - Collapsed sidebar: tooltip = `Label — ⌘3 / Ctrl+3`.  
  - Add `aria-keyshortcuts` attribute for accessibility.  

- [ ] Scopes  
  - Shortcuts live in `global` scope only.  
  - Inputs/textareas are ignored unless `allowInInputs: true`.  

- [ ] Tests  
  - **Unit**: `buildSidebarShortcuts()` generates unique combos for visible items.  
  - **E2E** (Playwright):  
    - When Analytics is 3rd → ⌘/Ctrl+3 navigates there.  
    - After reordering to 2nd → ⌘/Ctrl+2 navigates there.  
    - Hidden item collapses numbering correctly.  
    - Stable aliases (⌘/Ctrl+L) always navigate to Links.  

## Deliverables  
- `lib/nav/sidebar.ts` — sidebar item config.  
- `lib/shortcuts/buildFromSidebar.ts` — builder function.  
- `lib/shortcuts/registry.ts` — merged registry.  
- `lib/shortcuts/validator.ts` — conflict detection.  
- UI update — numeric hints + tooltips.  
- Tests — unit + E2E.  

## Out of Scope  
- Cheat-sheet modal for showing all shortcuts (`?` key). That will be a follow-up issue.

## Question

Comine this with the centralized shortcut system all in one issue

## Answer

Here’s a **combined Linear issue in Markdown** that merges the **centralized keyboard shortcut framework** with the **order-based sidebar shortcuts** into a single, world-class implementation.  

---

# ⌨️ Centralized Keyboard Shortcuts Framework + Sidebar Order Shortcuts  

## Goal  
Create a **single, centralized keyboard shortcut system** that powers all navigation and actions across Jovie. Ensure shortcuts are conflict-free, scope-aware, accessible, and **world-class UX**. Implement sidebar navigation shortcuts (⌘/Ctrl+1…9) that map dynamically to the order of visible primary items, plus stable aliases for money-path items.  

## Background  
- Currently, risk of decentralized `keydown` listeners → conflicts, inconsistent UX.  
- Need one source of truth (`registry.ts`) and a single provider.  
- Sidebar is the user’s anchor — tying ⌘/Ctrl+1…9 to the current order keeps muscle memory intact even if items are hidden or re-ordered.  
- YC principle: **fast, focused, revenue-aligned**. Shortcuts should push users to activation/MRR faster.  

---

## Requirements  

### 1. Centralized Framework  
- [ ] Install `tinykeys` (tiny, reliable).  
- [ ] Create **types** in `lib/shortcuts/types.ts`: `Shortcut`, `Scope`, `ShortcutRegistration`.  
- [ ] Create **registry** in `lib/shortcuts/registry.ts` → single array of all shortcuts.  
- [ ] Add `KeyboardShortcutsProvider` (one listener only).  
- [ ] Add `ShortcutScope` provider + `useShortcutScope` hook for scoping (`global | page | sheet | modal`).  
- [ ] Ignore inputs/textareas unless `allowInInputs: true`.  
- [ ] Never override OS/browser reserved combos (⌘R, ⌘W, etc.).  
- [ ] Add `aria-keyshortcuts` to UI elements with bindings.  
- [ ] Add validator (`lib/shortcuts/validator.ts`) to fail on conflicts (run in dev + CI).  
- [ ] Testing:  
  - Unit: validator blocks duplicate combos.  
  - E2E: smoke test for at least nav, command palette, and modal close.  

### 2. Sidebar Shortcuts (Dynamic by Order)  
- [ ] Create `SIDEBAR_ITEMS` config (`lib/nav/sidebar.ts`) as **single source of truth** for both rendering + shortcut bindings.  
  - Fields: `id`, `label`, `href`, `icon`, `group: primary|secondary|utility`, `enabled`.  
- [ ] Create builder (`lib/shortcuts/buildFromSidebar.ts`):  
  - Assign ⌘/Ctrl+1…9 based on **current visible primary items order**.  
  - Skip hidden/disabled items; renumber dynamically.  
  - Generate `ShortcutRegistration[]`.  
- [ ] Merge builder output into registry.  
- [ ] Provide **stable aliases** for money paths:  
  - ⌘/Ctrl+L → Links  
  - ⌘/Ctrl+G → Analytics  
- [ ] Visual cues:  
  - Expanded sidebar: faint numeric badges (1–9) on hover.  
  - Collapsed sidebar: tooltip includes label + shortcut (`Links — ⌘2`).  
- [ ] Add `aria-keyshortcuts` for accessibility.  
- [ ] Testing:  
  - E2E: ⌘3 navigates to 3rd item, reordering updates numbering.  
  - E2E: hidden items collapse numbering.  
  - E2E: ⌘L always goes to Links, ⌘G always goes to Analytics.
