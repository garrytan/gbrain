## Question

How old is cos 12.5

## Answer

“Cos 12.5” isn’t something that can have an *age* — cosine is a mathematical function, not a person or object.  

If you meant to **calculate** cos 12.5, here’s the distinction:  
- If the angle is in **radians**, cos 12.5 ≈ 0.997.  
- If the angle is in **degrees**, cos 12.5° ≈ 0.976.  

Could you clarify what you meant by “how old”?

## Question

Mac os


## Answer

Could you clarify what you’d like to know about macOS, Mr. White?  
For example — do you want:  
- The **latest macOS version** and its release date,  
- Help with **installation or upgrade**,  
- **Troubleshooting** (e.g., performance, network, or app issues), or  
- **Command-line / developer** guidance (e.g., zsh, brew, Xcode, etc.)?

## Question

Mac OS 12.5 is how old

## Answer

macOS 12.5 (Monterey) was released **July 20, 2022** citeturn0search9turn0search13turn0search16turn0search8  

So as of today (October 7, 2025), it is about **3 years and ~2.5 months** old.

## Question

Give me version history since

## Answer

Here’s a summary of the major macOS version history **after** macOS 12.5 (Monterey) up to now:  

| Version | Release / General Availability | Notes / Highlights |
|---|---|---|
| macOS 13 Ventura | October 24, 2022 citeturn0search20turn0search4 | Introduced Stage Manager, continuity camera, other refinements. citeturn0search20turn0search4 |
| macOS 14 Sonoma | September 26, 2023 citeturn0search4turn0search17turn0search0 | New widget capabilities, lock screen changes, video wallpapers, etc. citeturn0search17turn0search4 |
| macOS 15 Sequoia | September 16, 2024 citeturn0search15turn0search17 | Released with iPhone Mirroring, updated window tiling, password app, etc. citeturn0search15 |
| macOS 26 Tahoe | September 15, 2025 citeturn0search18turn0search17turn0search0turn0search4 | Current version. It’s also announced as the final version supporting Intel Macs. citeturn0search18turn0search17 |

If you want, I can also list all **minor point updates** (like 13.x, 14.x, etc.) between 12.5 and now. Do you want me to do that?

## Question

Minimum for display link

## Answer

The minimum **macOS version** officially supported by the current DisplayLink Manager software is **macOS 10.15 Catalina** citeturn0search0turn0search22turn0search13  

Older “legacy” DisplayLink drivers support earlier macOS versions (e.g. 10.14 Mojave, 10.13) in limited form, but these lack full functionality and support. citeturn0search22turn0search0turn0search9turn0search13

## Question

Is Tahoe 26.0.1 and qlab stable for live production?

## Answer

It’s risky. Here’s a breakdown of what I found and what to watch out for, so you can decide whether **macOS 26.0.1 “Tahoe” + QLab** is safe enough for live production.

---

## What we *do* know

**QLab compatibility:**
- QLab 5 requires **macOS Big Sur (11) or higher**. citeturn0search6turn0search33  
- The QLab download page confirms QLab 5 is supported on “macOS 11 or later.” citeturn0search33  
- The QLab 4 documentation states it supports up to **macOS Sonoma (14)** — i.e. QLab 4 is *not* guaranteed compatible with newer OS versions like Sequoia or Tahoe. citeturn0search2  
- Some users report that QLab Remote or network/collaboration features can break when macOS is updated beyond what QLab was tested against. citeturn0search21turn0search20  

So, QLab *can* run on newer macOS versions, but features may be unreliable outside those officially supported.

**Tahoe / early reports:**
- macOS Tahoe was announced in mid-2025, with first betas released in June. citeturn0search23turn0search41turn0search1  
- Because it’s new, many developers and hardware manufacturers **haven’t yet confirmed full support** for various apps, audio drivers, and peripherals on Tahoe. citeturn0search18  
- In reviews, Tahoe is described positively (snappy UI, Liquid Glass design), but those are not stress tests under live production loads. citeturn0search5  
- Some driver/hardware vendors (audio, plugins, etc.) explicitly state they have **no compatibility notes yet** for Tahoe. citeturn0search18  

---

## Risks in live production

- **Unverified compatibility**: QLab may launch, but certain features (audio interfaces, USB hubs, MIDI hardware, video outputs, network sync) might misbehave.
- **Plugin/driver issues**: Live shows often rely on third-party audio plugins, DSP hardware, networked devices. If those aren’t certified for Tahoe yet, you could experience glitches or failure.
- **Performance regressions or bugs**: New OS releases often introduce bugs, memory leaks, or regressions not detected until heavy use.
- **No proven track record**: Nobody can yet testify reliably about running complex, multi-cue live shows under Tahoe without hiccups.
- **Roll-back difficulty**: Updating to Tahoe might complicate returning to a known stable version if things fail mid-show.

---

## Conclusion & advice

Is **macOS 26.0.1 + QLab** stable enough for a **live production environment**? My judgment: **not yet reliable enough** to trust for a mission-critical show.

If I were in your shoes, I’d:

- Wait until QLab officially publishes compatibility statements for Tahoe with your version (likely QLab 5.x).
- Test thoroughly in a staging environment (replicate full show load) before trusting it in front of an audience.
- Stay on a version of macOS that’s been battle-tested with your QLab plus plugins/hardware until Tahoe proves its stability.

If you like, I can check whether QLab has announced compatibility for Tahoe since this info — would you want me

## Question

What version is the latest that is super stable

## Answer

There’s no one-size-fits-all “super stable” version — it depends on your hardware, drivers, and show setup — but based on what’s documented and widely used, here are my recommendations and reasoning:

---

## What’s officially supported

- QLab 5 requires **macOS Big Sur (11)** or higher. citeturn0search1  
- QLab 4 (latest versions) support up to **macOS Sonoma (14)**. citeturn0search3  
- The latest QLab version (as of now) is **QLab 5.5.5** (released September 17, 2025), and it still states the requirement “macOS 11 or later.” citeturn0search6  

So anything from **macOS 11 through versions just before Tahoe** is within the official compatibility range for QLab.

---

## What version to pick for stability

Given that Tahoe is brand new, and early adoption typically brings unexpected bugs, the safest bet is a **well-established macOS version** that’s had time in the wild.

A good candidate is **macOS Sequoia (version 15)** — it’s mature, and many users (in forums) report stable usage with QLab, plus by now drivers and plugins have had time to catch up.

Some anecdotal feedback:

- Some users caution that running QLab 5/5.x features (collaboration, network cues) may have quirks on newer macOS versions. citeturn0search14  
- On forums, there’s advice that **Sonoma** is “perfectly fine,” while urging caution for Sequoia early days, which suggests that Sonoma is a safer choice when Sequoia is still maturing. citeturn0search23  

So, for a *“stable as possible for live”* setup, I’d lean toward:

> **macOS Sonoma (v14.x, fully updated)**  

or, if you prefer more features and your hardware supports it, **macOS Sequoia (v15.x, post-patch)**.

---

If you tell me your Mac model (Intel or Apple Silicon) and the QLab version you’ll use, I can pick the best version for *your* setup.

## Question

What would be a newer one than sequioa

## Answer

The macOS version **after Sequoia (15)** is **macOS 26 Tahoe**, released **September 15, 2025**.  

Here’s the quick lineage for clarity:

| macOS Version | Codename | Release Date | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **15** | Sequoia | Sept 16 2024 | Introduced iPhone Mirroring, Passwords app, window tiling |
| **26** | Tahoe | Sept 15 2025 | New “Liquid Glass” UI, Intel Macs’ final support, improved Continuity, performance tweaks |

So Tahoe is the **newest** macOS after Sequoia — but as of Oct 2025 it’s **still early-cycle** (26.0.1). For mission-critical or live production (like QLab use), **Sonoma 14.x** or **late Sequoia 15.x** remain safer until Tahoe gets broader driver and app certification.
