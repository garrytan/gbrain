## Question

If I'm building an app in Vue, it's a progressive web app built in Vue, that I'm going to then, so that we can have easy on the web, but then we're going to wrap it for an iOS app. What, how should I handle payments? I'm like, initially thinking about using Stripe for payments, um, but, um, I want, but if it goes on the app store, then I want to be able to do billing through the app store. Um, and, but then I also need them to be able to do billing on the web. Um, how do we do that? Um, how do we handle all that? Um, so that it's as streamlined as possible. I don't want to have to like, can I set up Stripe to do billing? Um, do the app store or do I need like two separate billing? How does this work?

## Answer

Mr. White,

You’ll end up running two payment flows—Stripe on the web and Apple’s In-App Purchase (IAP) in your iOS wrapper—but you can unify them on the backend.

- **Web (PWA) → Stripe**  
  • Implement Stripe Checkout or Elements and Stripe Billing for subscriptions/pay-as-you-go.  
  • Handle webhooks (e.g. `invoice.paid`, `customer.subscription.updated`) in your server to grant access. citeturn0search1turn0search3  

- **iOS App → Apple IAP**  
  • For any digital goods or subscriptions sold inside the app, you must use StoreKit and IAP (auto-renewable or non-consumable).  
  • Configure products in App Store Connect and verify receipts server-side via Apple’s verification API. citeturn0search0turn0search2  

- **Unified Backend Logic**  
  • Normalize “entitlements” from both sources:  
    – On Stripe: mark user as active when webhook arrives.  
    – On Apple: verify receipt and update the same subscription record.  
  • Check a single flag in your app to unlock premium features, regardless of payment origin.  

- **Optional Simplifier: RevenueCat (or Paddle+RevenueCat)**  
  • Provides a single SDK/backend that manages Stripe (web) and IAP (iOS) subscriptions, syncing statuses automatically. citeturn0news20  

**Key takeaways:**  
1. You cannot use Stripe directly for in-app digital sales without Apple’s permission.  
2. You must integrate IAP for any purchases made inside the App Store build.  
3. Keep one backend subscription model and two payment integrations feeding into it.  

That setup keeps your PWA checkout lean with Stripe while staying compliant with Apple’s rules in the App Store.

## Question

Generator prompt that I can add to my builder.io conversation to make sure that it integrates all of this correctly

## Answer

Mr. White, here’s a single “generator” prompt you can paste into your Builder.io AI chat to scaffold everything end-to-end:

```
You’re a senior full-stack dev. My project is a Vue 3 PWA (Nuxt or Vue CLI) wrapped in Capacitor for iOS. I need subscription billing via Stripe on the web and Apple In-App Purchases (auto-renewables) in the iOS app, but with one unified backend entitlement system. Please generate:

1. **Backend (Node.js/Express)**  
   • Endpoint to create Stripe Checkout sessions/subscription links.  
   • Stripe webhook handlers for `invoice.paid`, `customer.subscription.updated` that update a centralized `subscriptions` table.  
   • Endpoint to receive StoreKit receipts, validate with Apple’s verifyReceipt API, and update the same `subscriptions` table.  

2. **Frontend (Vue 3)**  
   • Composable `useStripeSubscription()` that kicks off Stripe Checkout and listens for completion.  
   • Composable `useIAPSubscription()` using Capacitor’s StoreKit plugin to purchase and restore Apple subs, then POST receipts to the backend.  
   • `useSubscriptionStatus()` to fetch the unified status and gate premium features.  

3. **Builder.io integration**  
   • Custom code blocks or actions that call your Vue composables for both web and iOS flows.  
   • Prop drilling or global state setup so Builder sections show “Subscribe” buttons that trigger the right flow based on platform.  

4. **Setup notes**  
   • Stripe product/price IDs and environment variables.  
   • App Store Connect product identifiers and StoreKit config.  
   • Brief file-structure diagram and sample `.env`.  

Optionally show how to swap in RevenueCat for a single SDK backend. Provide code snippets, folder layout, and step-by-step instructions.```

Paste that into Builder.io’s AI chat and it’ll generate the full integration.

## Question

I'm considering using RevenueCat. How does that work? If I use RevenueCat, do I also need Stripe on top of that? Or, how does that work?

## Answer

Mr. White,

**How RevenueCat works**  
- **Central subscription layer**  
  RevenueCat sits between your app and payment providers, wrapping StoreKit on iOS/Apple and Stripe on web so you don’t have to build or maintain receipt-validation, webhook handling, or entitlement logic yourself citeturn1search0turn0search1.  

- **Web (PWA) → Stripe**  
  You still need a Stripe account and to create your Products/Price IDs there, but instead of writing your own Stripe Checkout and webhook handlers, you connect Stripe to RevenueCat. Their Web SDK will launch Stripe Checkout and send payments/receipt events into RevenueCat’s backend automatically citeturn0search0turn0search3.  

- **iOS App → StoreKit**  
  Inside your Capacitor/wrapped app, you install RevenueCat’s Purchases SDK. Under the hood it uses StoreKit (or StoreKit 2) to handle in-app purchases, then forwards and validates receipts on RevenueCat’s servers citeturn1search0.  

- **Unified entitlements**  
  Both web-Stripe and in-app purchases feed into the same RevenueCat subscription records. Your client code just asks “is this user entitled?” via RevenueCat’s API/SDK—no need to check two different backends citeturn0search1.  

**Do you still need Stripe?**  
- **Yes, for web payments:** RevenueCat doesn’t process credit cards itself. You’ll connect your Stripe account to RevenueCat and let their Web SDK handle checkout and webhooks.  
- **No direct Stripe coding required:** You avoid writing your own subscription logic—RevenueCat’s integration covers it.

This gives you a single source-of-truth for subscriptions across web and iOS with minimal custom code.
