## Question

You know, for windsurf and cloud and autocloud, autocloud and cursor, using local work trees and with cursor and running multiple AI agents at a time on code, but using cursor, windsurf, and autocloud, and autocloud runs multiple cloud code instances locally in GitHub work trees. That's my workflow and like a turbo repo with the Next.js app, and it's 100% of what we're using the machine for. I need to get in. We're seeing slow speeds on a 2022 M2 with 16 gigabytes of RAM and a terabyte internal drive, and I'm trying to figure out how to eliminate that bottleneck in the most cost-effective manner.

## Answer

Mr. White — with that workflow (multiple IDEs + multiple local “agent” processes + multiple git worktrees), the usual bottleneck on a 2022 M2 / 16GB is **memory pressure → swap → everything feels slow** (and the second most common is **indexing/file-watching huge trees** like `node_modules`, `.next`, `dist`, etc.).

## Fastest way to find the real bottleneck (5 minutes)
1. **Activity Monitor → Memory**
   - If **Memory Pressure is yellow/red** and **Swap Used** is climbing (even a few GB), you’ve found it: 16GB unified memory is the limiter.
2. **Activity Monitor → CPU**
   - If you see “Indexing”, “Language Server”, “ripgrep”, “tsserver”, Cursor/Windsurf processes pegging cores, it’s likely **indexing/search** thrash.
3. **Activity Monitor → Disk**
   - If disk writes spike while memory pressure is high, that’s swap thrash (still memory-rooted).

## Highest-ROI fixes (usually immediate)
### 1) Stop the IDEs from indexing junk
**Cursor**
- If your repo is large, Cursor users report **Agent becomes extremely slow when Codebase Indexing is on**; disabling it or re-computing index + ignoring big folders helps. citeturn0search0turn0search12  
- Also, there are reports of **Cursor v2.0/v2.1 lag/stutter** where downgrading to v1.7 restored speed. citeturn0search3  
- Add ignore patterns (at minimum):
  - `**/node_modules/**`
  - `**/.next/**`
  - `**/dist/**`
  - `**/build/**`
  - `**/.turbo/**`
  - `**/.git/**`

**Windsurf**
- Windsurf supports a gitignore-style ignore file (`.codeiumignore`) to prevent indexing folders. citeturn0search4  
- Same patterns as above.

**Why this matters:** indexing/searching those folders is a classic “monorepo feels broken” cause in VS Code–style editors too. citeturn0search9turn0search8

### 2) Cap parallel agents + worktrees so you don’t blow RAM
- Each extra agent + editor window often brings another language server, index, watcher set, and Node process.
- Practical rule: **don’t run more concurrent agents than you have “free” RAM headroom**. On 16GB, that’s usually *not many* once you include Chrome + dev servers + Docker.

### 3) Make worktrees cheaper
- Keep worktrees, but **share the same dependency store** (pnpm store already helps) and avoid duplicated heavy build artifacts per worktree (`.next`, `dist`).
- Ensure `.next/` is ignored everywhere so it doesn’t get indexed.

## If you want the most cost-effective *real* fix
If Activity Monitor shows swap/memory pressure during your normal workflow, the cost-effective answer is: **more unified memory**. You can’t upgrade RAM in that Mac, so it means a different machine.

**Target spec for your exact workflow:** A Mac with **32GB+ unified memory** (36GB is even better) and ideally **more performance cores** (Pro/Max class).
- This directly reduces swap thrash and makes multiple agents/worktrees behave normally.

If you tell me what Activity Monitor shows for **Memory Pressure + Swap Used** while you’re running your “typical” number of agents/worktrees

## Question

Okay, so go for a MacBook or a laptop that has 32 gigs more. What's the most effective one? Should I go for 48 RAM? Should I go for 64, 128? Or should we do it on an M4 Pro, or should we get in and use the new M5s, or should we wait two weeks for the M5 Pro?

## Answer

Mr. White — for your “multiple IDEs + multiple agents + multiple worktrees” workflow, **RAM is the purchase driver**. Chip generation matters, but **once you stop swap/memory-pressure thrash, performance jumps the most**.

## What to buy (most cost-effective)
### Best value sweet spot: **48GB unified memory**
- In Apple’s current MacBook Pro lineup, **48GB is a standard/config option on the Pro/Max tiers** and is usually the best $/performance point for heavy multitasking. citeturn1view1turn0search2turn0search0  
- For your use case, **48GB is the first tier where you can run several agents + dev servers + browsers without living in swap**.

### “Never think about it again” headroom: **64GB**
Go 64GB if you routinely do any of these *while* running agents:
- Docker / multiple containers
- multiple Next.js dev servers + builds in parallel
- large monorepo indexing across multiple worktrees
- local LLMs (even modest ones) or lots of background automation

64GB is real headroom, but it’s a meaningful price jump. Apple lists 64GB/128GB as configurable options on higher-end configs. citeturn1view1turn0search5

### Usually overkill for your described workflow: **128GB**
128GB is for people doing things like large on-device models, heavy 3D/video pipelines, huge datasets, or lots of VMs. Apple positions 128GB primarily with the top Max config. citeturn0search0turn0search5

## M4 Pro vs M4 Max (for your workload)
- **M4 Pro + 48GB** = best value for code + agents (CPU/IO/memory capacity is what you feel).
- **M4 Max** is worth it mainly if you also need **big GPU throughput** (ML on-device, heavy graphics/video). For pure Next.js + agents, Max is often “nice, not necessary.”

## M4 Pro now vs waiting for M5 Pro “in ~2 weeks”
What’s known right now:
- Apple already shipped the **base 14" MacBook Pro with M5** in Oct 2025. citeturn2search5turn2news29  
- Multiple sources expect **M5 Pro / M5 Max MacBook Pros in early 2026**, with some signs pointing to a **late-January window** — but it’s still not guaranteed until Apple announces it. citeturn2search3turn2search0turn1view0

**Decision rule:**
- If you can tolerate the pain for ~2 weeks: **wait.** Best case, you buy **M5 Pro with 48–64GB**; worst case, you buy **M4 Pro/Max at a discount** right after any announcement.
- If you need relief this week: buy **M4 Pro 48GB** now. You’ll feel the gain immediately, and the “regret delta” vs M5 Pro is usually smaller than the delta between **16GB and 48GB**.

## My pick for you
- **Most cost-effective:** **MacBook Pro (Pro-tier) with 48GB unified memory** (M4 Pro today; or M5 Pro if it lands late January). citeturn0search2turn2search3  
- **If you want extra insurance:** **64GB** (only if your parallelism is extreme or you run lots of containers/LLMs). citeturn1view1turn0search5

## Question

Can I buy now and exchange in 2 weeks?

## Answer

Mr. White — **yes, if you buy from the right place.** The key is the return/exchange window.

## Best option if you want a “2-week safety valve”
### Buy from Apple (Apple Store / apple.com)
- Apple lets you **return or exchange within 14 calendar days of the date you receive the product**. citeturn2view1turn2view2  
- **Watch the math:** if you receive it **Jan 14, 2026**, day 14 is **Jan 28, 2026**.

**Important nuance:** Apple notes exchanges have exceptions, including **custom-configured (CTO) Macs**. citeturn2view2  
- So if you want the smoothest “swap it for the new M5 Pro,” **buy a standard in-stock config** (e.g., MBP M4 Pro + 48GB that’s a normal SKU), not a special-order build.

## If you want more than 14 days of flexibility
### Costco
- Costco’s official policy lists **Computers** under electronics that must be returned **within 90 days of receipt**. citeturn2view0  
That’s the most forgiving “I might swap when M5 Pro actually appears” option.

## Practical playbook
1. **Buy from Apple if you only need ~14 days** (and choose an in-stock config if you want an easy exchange). citeturn2view2  
2. **Buy from Costco if you want real runway** (90 days). citeturn2view0  
3. Keep **all packaging/accessories**, and make sure any Apple anti-theft features can be disabled before returning (Apple can refuse returns if they can’t be disabled). citeturn2view1  

If you tell me where you’d buy (Apple vs Costco vs Best Buy) and whether you’d order a **custom** config, I’ll tell you the cleanest way to ensure you can swap to an M5 Pro with minimal hassle.

## Question

M4 pro with 48gb ram and 1TB hdd today vs m5 pro in a month?

## Answer

Mr. White — if the choice is **M4 Pro / 48GB / 1TB today** vs **M5 Pro “in ~a month”**, the practical answer is:

### If you’re currently bottlenecked (swap / memory pressure): **buy the M4 Pro 48GB now**
- Going from **16GB → 48GB** is the step-change that fixes your workflow (multiple agents, multiple worktrees, multiple IDE processes). The CPU generation matters far less once you stop swapping.
- Apple sells an **M4 Pro MacBook Pro with 48GB unified memory** as a standard configuration. citeturn0search1turn0search5

### What you’re likely “missing” by not waiting
- Apple already shipped the **base M5 MacBook Pro** in Oct 2025, and claims uplifts vs M4 (e.g., multithreaded CPU and AI / GPU metrics), but **M5 Pro / Max timing isn’t official**. citeturn0news39turn0news40  
- Current reporting/rumors point to **late January 2026 (e.g., Jan 28)** as a possible window, but that’s still speculative until Apple announces it. citeturn0search6turn0search0

Net: waiting might get you a nice year-over-year bump, but it’s unlikely to feel as dramatic as “stop swapping by adding RAM.”

---

## The smartest way to do “buy now but keep the option to switch”
**Don’t rely on Apple’s return window if you mean “a month.”**
- Apple’s policy is **14 calendar days from receipt** for returns. citeturn0search2turn0search7  
That usually won’t cover a full month.

So if you want a true month-long safety valve:
- Buy from a retailer with a longer return window (Costco is the classic example, but confirm your exact membership/purchase category policy before buying).

---

## My recommendation (cost-effective, lowest regret)
1) **Buy M4 Pro + 48GB + 1TB now** if the slowdown is costing you real hours each week.  
2) **Only “wait for M5 Pro”** if you can tolerate the current machine *and* you can buy in a way that preserves a long return window.

If you tell me **how many simultaneous agents** you typically run at peak (and whether Docker is on), I’ll tell you whether **48GB is enough** or if you should jump straight to **64GB**.

## Question

With autoclaude I can real rack up agents like 10+

## Answer

Mr. White — if you’re routinely running **10+ agents**, **48GB is very likely still a bottleneck**. On the *MacBook Pro specifically*, Apple’s own specs show **M4 Pro tops out at 48GB unified memory**; to go higher you have to step up to **M4 Max (64GB or 128GB options)**. citeturn0search1turn0search3turn0search0

## What I’d do for 10+ agents
### Most cost-effective that actually fixes it (laptop)
**MacBook Pro + M4 Max + 64GB + 1TB**
- 64GB is the first tier where “10+ parallel things” usually stops feeling fragile.
- You’re not paying for 128GB unless you truly need “never think about it again” headroom.
- Apple lists 64GB and 128GB as available memory configs on M4 Max. citeturn0search1turn0search3

### When 128GB is justified
Go **128GB** if you do *any* of these alongside the agents:
- Docker-heavy dev (multiple containers), lots of parallel builds, multiple IDEs + browsers always open
- running local models / embeddings / heavy background indexing
Apple supports up to **128GB unified memory** on M4 Max configs. citeturn0search1turn0search3

### Don’t buy M4 Pro 48GB if you truly want 10+ agents *locally*
Because you can’t upgrade later, and the MBP M4 Pro simply doesn’t go beyond 48GB. citeturn0search1turn0search3

## “M4 Max 64GB now” vs “M5 Pro in a month”
- Apple already shipped a **base M5** (14" MBP) update in Oct 2025, but that’s not the Pro/Max tier you’re deciding between. citeturn0news33  
- Even if an **M5 Pro** lands soon, the *felt* win for you comes from **having enough RAM to avoid swap**. The jump from 48→64 is usually more meaningful than one chip generation for this workload.

**So:**
- If you want the machine to *just handle 10+ agents*: **buy M4 Max 64GB now**.
- If you want maximum runway and you’ll actually use it: **M4 Max 128GB**.

## Cheapest alternative (if you want to keep a lighter laptop)
Run the agents on a **separate headless box** (Mac Studio / Mac mini / Linux workstation) and use your laptop as the editor/terminal. That often beats paying the laptop “Max + lots of RAM” premium.

If you tell me whether those 10+ agents are doing **full repo indexing + builds** or mostly **LLM-driven code edits**, I’ll tell you whether **64GB is enough** or you should just go **128GB**.

## Question

Or will the m4 drop in price in 2 weeks? 

Is Amazon better that Apple for buying?

## Answer

Mr. White —

## Will the M4 drop in price in 2 weeks?
**Maybe at retailers; unlikely at Apple.**

- **Apple usually keeps MSRP** and instead stops selling older configs or shifts them to Apple Refurbished; it *can* change prices, but it’s not the common outcome right after an update. citeturn0search12  
- **Retailers (Amazon/Best Buy/B&H) are the ones who discount** when inventory needs to move—especially if/when an M5 Pro announcement happens. Deal sites note “small price cuts…after new releases,” with bigger discounts around major sales periods. citeturn0search24turn0search17  
- If you buy **from Apple** and **Apple lowers the price within 14 days**, Apple’s policy says you can request a refund/credit of the difference (with exclusions for limited-time promos). citeturn1view1  

**Translation:** a 2-week drop is plausible *at retailers*, but not guaranteed—and it’s usually not massive unless there’s a clear inventory push.

---

## Is Amazon better than Apple for buying?
Depends on what you value:

### Apple is better if you want minimum hassle + certainty
- **14-day returns** from the date you receive it. citeturn1view1  
- **Price protection** if Apple drops price within 14 days (again, exclusions apply). citeturn1view1  
- Guaranteed **new/authorized**, easy AppleCare add-ons, cleaner support path.

### Amazon is better if the price is meaningfully lower (and you buy smart)
- Amazon generally has a **30-day return window** outside holiday exceptions. citeturn0search25  
- But policies vary by item/seller, and holiday rules have had **Apple-product exceptions** (example: holiday period returns for Apple products ending earlier). citeturn0search29turn0search22  

**If you buy on Amazon:** only buy listings that are **Ships from Amazon + Sold by Amazon** (avoid Marketplace sellers), and verify it’s **new** (not “renewed/open box”) unless you explicitly want that.

---

## What I’d do in your situation (10+ agents)
- If you’re trying to catch a potential M5 Pro announcement + price moves: **buy from a retailer with a longer return window than Apple** (Costco is the classic, but you asked Amazon vs Apple—Amazon usually gives you more runway than Apple’s 14 days). citeturn0search25turn1view1  
- If you want the cleanest “no drama” experience: **Apple**, but accept that it won’t cover a full “wait a month” strategy. citeturn1view1  

If you tell me which exact config you’re looking at (14" vs 16", M4 Pro vs Max, and seller/store), I’ll tell you the safest “buy-now” move that preserves your option to switch.

## Question

Right now im on windsurf with only 2 agents running. Ram is maxed swap file is 16gb

## Answer

Mr. White — that’s definitive: **you’re memory-bound and thrashing swap**. With RAM maxed and **16GB swap**, your machine is spending a lot of time paging memory to disk, which is exactly the “everything feels slow” symptom.

## What to do immediately (today)
1. **Close big memory hogs first**
   - Chrome (especially lots of tabs), Slack/Discord, Docker/Colima, Figma, etc.
2. **Stop IDE indexing on junk folders**
   - In Windsurf, add a `.codeiumignore` to exclude:
     - `**/node_modules/**`
     - `**/.next/**`
     - `**/dist/**`
     - `**/build/**`
     - `**/.turbo/**`
     - `**/.git/**`
   Windsurf supports `.codeiumignore` for skipping folders from indexing. citeturn0search4
3. **Reduce parallelism in dev**
   - Don’t run multiple Next.js dev servers at once across worktrees.
   - Avoid “watch” processes you don’t need.
4. **Hard reset the runaway state**
   - Save work → reboot. It clears the worst memory fragmentation + stuck processes.

These steps can cut swap, but they won’t change the underlying reality: **16GB unified memory is not enough** for your workflow.

## Hardware decision based on your numbers
With only **2 agents** and already at **16GB swap**, you should plan for:
- **Minimum: 64GB unified memory**
- **Better if you want 10+ agents locally: 128GB unified memory**

Why: you’re already exceeding physical RAM by a lot at low load. Scaling to 10+ agents will explode swap again unless you massively increase unified memory.

On MacBook Pro, that means:
- **Skip M4 Pro** (it tops out at 48GB).
- Go **M4 Max with 64GB or 128GB**.

## Buy now vs wait for M5 Pro
Given you’re already swap-thrashing:
- If you need relief now: **buy now** (M4 Max 64GB minimum).
- If you can wait: you *can*, but the key is still **RAM tier**, not the “M5” label.

## One quick diagnostic that will sharpen the recommendation
Open **Activity Monitor → Memory** and tell me:
- the top 3 processes by **Memory** (names + GB)
- whether **“Compressed”** is huge

With that, I can tell you whether **64GB is enough** or you should just go straight to **128GB**.

## Question

## Answer

Mr. White — that screenshot is a textbook **swap-thrash** situation.

### What the screenshot says (why it’s slow)
- **Swap Used: ~26.8GB** and **Compressed: ~6.23GB** → macOS is fighting to keep you alive, so everything stalls.
- Top offenders:
  - `node (vitest)` at **~9.62GB**, **~8.04GB**, **~7.84GB** (that’s ~25GB just in vitest)
  - `next-server` at **~4.82GB**
- You’re effectively trying to run a **~30–40GB working set** on a **16GB** machine. That guarantees slowness even with only 2 agents.

## Fix the bottleneck today (immediate)
### 1) Stop the runaway test runners
You have **three** separate vitest node processes eating absurd RAM.
- Kill those `node (vitest)` processes (or stop the test command), then restart your dev session.
- Then re-run vitest with **lower parallelism**:
  - run tests **single-thread / fewer workers**
  - avoid watch mode if it’s holding memory
  - split test runs by package/worktree so you don’t have multiple heavy pools simultaneously

If vitest is supposed to be lightweight for you, this also strongly suggests a **leak or an accidental “spawn multiple vitest instances”** pattern (common with worktrees + watchers).

### 2) Cap Node memory to prevent swap spirals
As a guardrail, set a cap so a single test run can’t eat the machine:
- `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=2048"` (or 3072/4096)
This may cause an OOM (fail fast), but it prevents the whole OS from going unresponsive.

### 3) Don’t run multiple watchers across worktrees
Worktrees + turbo + Next + vitest + multiple IDEs = tons of watchers.
- Ensure only **one** Next dev server per repo at a time (or use one shared dev server).
- Ensure only **one** vitest watcher.

## What to buy (based on *your* numbers)
With **2 agents** and you’re already at **~27GB swap**, **48GB is not the right target** for your “10+ agents + worktrees + dev servers” reality.

### Minimum that will feel “normal”: **64GB unified memory**
This should eliminate swap in the common case and make the machine responsive.

### If you want to comfortably run 10+ agents *and* keep tests/dev servers going: **128GB**
This is the “no babysitting” tier for your workload.

**Practical recommendation:**  
- If you want a laptop: **MacBook Pro with Max-tier chip + 64GB (minimum), 128GB (ideal)**.  
- I would not buy an M4 Pro 48GB for this workload; you’d still be flirting with swap.

## Quick next step (so we don’t guess)
Tell me what those three `node (vitest)` processes correspond to:
- Are they from **multiple worktrees**, or does **one** worktree spawn multiple?
If you answer that, I’ll tell you the exact config change to stop the vitest memory explosion (and you’ll likely get a big speedup even before you upgrade).

## Answer

Mr. White — the big problem in that list is **`next-server (v16.1.1)` at 5.53 GB**. Everything else is comparatively normal “Electron app + lots of tabs/helpers” noise (Windsurf/Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT renderers, WindowServer, etc.).

### Fast triage (2 minutes)
1. **Quit/Restart the Next dev server**
   - If it’s a dev server, it’s the #1 suspect for runaway RAM (watchers, source maps, cache growth, leaking requests).
2. **Close extra Electron renderers**
   - Windsurf/Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT: every tab/window/extension host spawns processes. Close unused windows, disable heavy extensions, restart those apps.

### Fix the Next server ballooning
In your project folder:

```bash
# stop it cleanly
lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P | grep -E ':(3000|3001|8080|5173)'

# if you know the PID (your list shows 28080)
kill -TERM 28080
# if it won't die:
kill -9 28080

# nuke Next cache (common cause of weirdness)
rm -rf .next

# reinstall deps if you suspect corruption
rm -rf node_modules
npm ci

# run again
npm run dev
```

If it *only* happens after the server runs for a while:
- **Look for a memory leak** in API routes, websocket handlers, background intervals, logging buffers, or large in-memory caches.
- If you’re using image optimization heavily, large responses, or server actions that retain references, memory can climb.

To confirm whether it’s a Node heap leak vs “native/other” memory:
```bash
# quick heap snapshot style signal (Chrome DevTools attach)
node --inspect node_modules/.bin/next dev
```
Then open `chrome://inspect` → take heap snapshots over time. If retained objects keep growing, it’s a leak.

### Reduce background load from Windsurf/Cursor/Claude
You have lots of “Helper (Renderer/Plugin)” and many ~38–45MB `node` processes—usually extension hosts, file watchers, language servers.
- Close extra workspaces/projects
- Disable extensions you don’t need (especially AI, linting, indexers)
- Restart the app after long uptime

### When to worry
Check **Activity Monitor → Memory tab → Memory Pressure**:
- **Green:** you’re fine; macOS will cache aggressively.
- **Yellow/Red + lots of swap:** you need to kill the hogs (start with `next-server`, then big Electron apps).

If you tell me whether this is **`next dev`** or a **production server**, and what port it’s listening on, I’ll give you the most likely leak culprits and the exact profiling path.

## Question

Will the m5 pro have ram higher than what \s avalble on m\the m4pro

## Answer

Mr. White — there’s **no official info yet** on an **M5 Pro** chip’s maximum unified memory, so nobody can say for sure.

What we *can* say today:

- **M4 Pro (current)**: MacBook Pro configs go **up to 48GB unified memory**. citeturn10view1  
- **M5 (base chip, not Pro)**: configs go **up to 32GB unified memory**. citeturn10view2  

So: **we don’t know** whether **M5 Pro** will exceed the **48GB max** of **M4 Pro** until Apple announces it.

## Question

M4max goes to 128 right

## Answer

Mr. White — **yes, M4 Max goes up to 128GB unified memory** (config option on the 16-core CPU M4 Max). citeturn0search2

For your other question: **there’s no official info yet on whether M5 Pro will exceed M4 Pro’s max memory**, so anything would be speculation until Apple publishes specs. **Right now, M4 Pro tops out at 64GB unified memory**. citeturn0search2

## Question

Any rumors suggesting it would or wouldnt

## Answer

Mr. White — yep: **M4 Max supports up to 128GB of unified memory**. citeturn18view0  
And **M4 Pro supports up to 64GB**. citeturn18view0

On **M5 Pro**: as of the latest credible info, **Apple has announced M5 (base) but not published specs for an “M5 Pro” memory ceiling**, and the rumor coverage I’m seeing focuses on *timing / product refreshes* rather than *memory tiers*. citeturn23view0turn24news18  

So: **no solid rumor yet that M5 Pro will exceed M4 Pro’s 64GB, and no solid rumor that it won’t**—just not specified in reliable leaks/briefings so far. citeturn24news18

## Question

If they upped ram like say the m5max goes up to 256gb and the min jumps from 16gb to 32gb then wed proabbly get more ram for the same price right? In which case a wait is warranted? And if so how likely is that?

## Answer

Mr. White — yes: **M4 Max tops out at 128GB unified memory**, and **M4 Pro tops out at 64GB**. citeturn6search14

### Are there rumors that M5 Pro/Max will exceed M4 Pro/Max RAM?
Right now, I’m **not seeing credible/leaky reporting** that specifically claims **M5 Pro > 64GB** or **M5 Max > 128GB**.

What we *can* anchor on is Apple’s recent pattern:
- **Max-tier ceiling** went **64 → 96 → 128 → 128** across M1/M2/M3/M4. citeturn10search11turn6search14  
  That makes a jump to **256GB on the very next Max** feel **unlikely without a big packaging/memory change** (and we’d usually see stronger leakage if it were coming).

Also, Apple’s **base M5 14" MacBook Pro** (the one Apple already refreshed) still starts at **16GB** and kept the same starting price—so there’s **no sign of a near-term “base doubles to 32GB” shift** from that refresh. citeturn12news37

### If Apple *did* raise tiers (e.g., 32GB base, 256GB max), would you get more RAM for the same price?
**Usually yes at the same starting price**, but Apple can (and sometimes does) **reprice configs or make higher RAM a pricier upsell**, so it’s not guaranteed.

### Is waiting warranted, and how likely is your “32GB base / 256GB Max” scenario?
- **256GB on “M5 Max” specifically:** I’d rate it **low likelihood** based on the recent ceiling holding at 128GB on M4 Max and no solid leaks saying otherwise. citeturn10search11turn6search14  
- **Base jumping 16 → 32GB soon:** also **low**, because the **M5 base MBP stayed at 16GB**. citeturn12news37

**Practical take:**  
- If you *need* **>64GB** now, waiting for M5 Pro is probably **not** a smart bet.  
- If you *need* **>128GB**, waiting for M5 Max to hit 256GB is an even **worse bet**—that kind of jump is more plausible with a later generation or different tiering.

If you tell me the **RAM you actually need (64/96/128/192+)** and what you’re doing (LLM local, AE, Xcode, etc.), I’ll give you the clean “buy now vs wait” call.
