## Question

26 beta issues

## Answer

Please clarify what you mean by "26 beta issues." Are you referring to:

- iOS 17.6 or iOS 18 beta (possibly iOS 18 beta 6)?
- macOS 14.6 beta or macOS Sequoia beta?
- A specific app's version 26 beta?
- Something else entirely (e.g. TestFlight build #26)?

Let me know so I can give you a precise answer.

## Question

Ios

## Answer

It seems you're referring to **iOS 26**, but that version doesn’t exist yet. According to Apple's own documentation, the latest release is **iOS 18**, and its listed successor (“iOS 26”) is clearly a placeholder or error citeturn0search25.

So if you meant **“beta issues” in the current beta**, it’s likely for **iOS 18 beta**. Here are the most commonly reported problems:

---

### 🔥 Common iOS 18 Beta Issues

1. **Battery drain & overheating**  
   • Many users report significant battery depletion and phone overheating during beta use citeturn0search3turn0search5turn0search17.

2. **Install/update failures**  
   • Beta downloads/install process can hang or fail citeturn0search5.

3. **App crashes and freezes**  
   • Crashing in Photos, Messages, third-party apps (especially Instagram, Snapchat), and VoiceOver issues citeturn0search0turn0search7turn0search9.

4. **Connectivity bugs**  
   • Bluetooth and Wi‑Fi instability – some users lose access to Bluetooth in apps, CarPlay disconnections citeturn0search7turn0search5turn0news23.

5. **Face ID & Notifications**  
   • Problems with Face ID not working reliably; notifications not appearing on lock screen citeturn0search3turn0search17.

6. **Messages app glitch**  
   • Replies from Apple Watch triggering message crashes (only in initial iOS 18 builds, fixed in 18.1) citeturn0news19.

7. **AI/Privacy issues**  
   • Beta 18.3 temporarily disables AI news summary due to false info (“hallucinations”) citeturn0news20.  
   • Some privacy concerns around “Enhanced Visual Search” uploading photos to Apple citeturn0news21.

8. **Minor UI bugs**

### ✅ What you can do

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Backup** before installing any beta. |
| 2 | Monitor battery and temperature through Settings → Battery. Use Low Power Mode if needed. |
| 3 | Update to the **latest beta build**—new versions usually address earlier bugs. |
| 4 | Report issues via the **Feedback** app; more reports = quicker fixes. |
| 5 | If critical issues occur, consider **downgrading** temporarily to the latest stable (e.g. iOS 17.7.x or iOS 18.x).

## Question

No the ios26 beta is out

## Answer

Here are the top reported issues with the **iOS 26 Developer Beta** so far:

---

### 🛑 Common Problems

**1. App crashes & freezes**  
Frequent force-closes and unresponsiveness in both Apple and third-party apps. PassFab confirms "App Crashes and Freezing" among most common problems citeturn0search20. Reddit users echo this, saying it’s “buggier than beta 1,” with random crashes citeturn0search4.

**2. UI glitches & design rough edges**  
The new Liquid Glass interface has visual inconsistencies—crowded Control Center, misaligned icons, odd spacing in Settings/messages citeturn0news35turn0search20. Users call the design “jarringly cluttered” citeturn0news35, and app icons like Clock have been slammed as “a real mess” citeturn0news36.

**3. Battery drain & overheating**  
Some report quicker battery loss, though impressions vary. A MacRumors thread and Facebook group note mild draining, but Beta 2 seems more stable citeturn0search9turn0search14turn0search20.

**4. Thermal management**  
Early Beta 1 had heating issues, which are improving in Beta 2 per user reports citeturn0search9turn0search4.

**5. Connectivity & charging quirks**  
Reports of intermittent Wi‑Fi handoffs and MagSafe charging hiccups persist from Beta 1 into Beta 2 citeturn0search4turn0search9.

**6. Audio/FaceTime issues**  
Some beta testers say FaceTime feels “worse,” and audio sometimes doesn’t work as expected citeturn0search4turn0search20.

---

### ✅ Improvements in Beta 2 (Released June 23):

- **Liquid Glass refinements**: Tighter blur effects in Control Center, contrast improvements citeturn0search7turn0search9.  
- **Usability tweaks**: Safari moved its tab button, added gesture navigation; improved Control Center blur citeturn0search3turn0search7.  
- **New features**:  
  - *Recovery Assistant* enables device rescue without a computer citeturn0news37  
  - Enhanced Wallet tracking, redesigned ringtones, updated Passkey UI in Settings citeturn0search3turn0search7.

---

### 🧭 What You Can Do

- **Use Beta 2 (Build 23A5276f)**—released June 23, 2025 citeturn0search9turn0search42.  
- **Avoid primary devices**: Advice from Apple forums: “DO NOT install beta software on your primary device” citeturn0search13.  
- **Backup first**: Archive backup recommended in case you need to downgrade citeturn0search13.  
- **Report issues** via Feedback.  
- **Workarounds**:
  - Toggle Beta updates off/on or reboot if Beta 2 isn’t showing citeturn0search4turn0search17.  
  - For battery or apps misbehaving, try reinstalling or waiting for app updates.

---

🎯 **Bottom line**: iOS 26 Beta is feature-rich—Liquid Glass design, Recovery Assistant, nudity detection enhancements—but still unstable. If you're running Beta 2, you're seeing safety and UI enhancements but also encountering growing pains. Apple is polishing ahead of the public beta due in July and full release expected in September citeturn0news39turn0search42.

## Question

What should I use to develop our new swift app

## Answer

For a modern Swift app in 2025, use the following stack:

---

### ✅ **Core Stack**

#### 1. **Language & Framework**
- **Swift 5.10+**
- **SwiftUI 3** (preferred) or UIKit if legacy support is critical  
  → Use SwiftUI unless you hit a hard limitation; it’s now mature and ideal for new apps.

#### 2. **IDE**
- **Xcode 16** (latest beta if you're targeting iOS 26)  
  → Use the latest stable unless you need access to beta APIs like new system widgets.

#### 3. **Architecture**
- **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel)  
  → Works well with SwiftUI’s reactive bindings. Use `ObservableObject` and `@Published`.

#### 4. **State Management**
- **Combine** (built-in)
- For more complex needs: **The Composable Architecture (TCA)** by Point-Free.

---

### 🔌 **Backend & Auth (pick stack)**

**Option A – Supabase + Clerk**  
- Supabase for Postgres + Realtime DB + Storage  
- Clerk.dev for auth (email/password, OAuth, biometrics)

**Option B – Firebase**
- Realtime DB, Firestore, auth, analytics, push  
- Downsides: SDK bloat and lock-in.

**Option C – Custom backend**
- Swift app → REST or GraphQL API (e.g., Laravel or Node)  
- Use this if you already have a backend team or want tight control.

---

### 🧪 **CI/CD & Testing**

- **Fastlane** for builds, TestFlight uploads, screenshots
- **GitHub Actions** or **Bitrise** for CI/CD
- **XCTest**, optionally **Quick/Nimble** for more expressive tests

---

### 📦 **Third-party Tools**

- **RevenueCat** – in-app subscriptions
- **Mixpanel / Amplitude** – product analytics
- **Sentry / Firebase Crashlytics** – crash reporting
- **Kingfisher** or **SDWebImage** – image caching
- **Lottie** – for lightweight animations
- **Apollo** – if using GraphQL

---

### 🌐 **App Configuration**

- Use **Feature flags** (e.g., via LaunchDarkly or Firebase Remote Config)
- Separate **dev/staging/prod schemes** in Xcode
- Store env vars in `.xcconfig` files or use a secret manager for CI
