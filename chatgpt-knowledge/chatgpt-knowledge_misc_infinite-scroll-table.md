## Question

infinite scroll table

## Answer

An **infinite scroll table** is a UI pattern where a table loads and appends more rows automatically as the user scrolls down — instead of loading all data at once or using traditional pagination. It’s especially useful with large datasets because it fetches data in chunks from a server as needed. citeturn0search0

### How it works
- As the user scrolls near the bottom, JavaScript detects the scroll position.
- A request is sent to the server (e.g., via AJAX or fetch).
- New rows are appended to the table body.
- This process repeats indefinitely until no more data exists. citeturn0search1

### Key elements in implementation
1. **Scroll detection:**  
   Listen for scroll events on the container or window, and trigger a data fetch when the user gets near the bottom.  
2. **Fetching data:**  
   Use AJAX/fetch to request a batch of rows from an API or database.  
3. **Appending rows:**  
   Add new `<tr>` elements to the `<tbody>` once data arrives.  
4. **Optional optimization:**  
   Use Intersection Observer instead of scroll events for better performance. citeturn0search1

### Basic example (vanilla JS concept)
```html
<table id="table">
  <thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody></tbody>
</table>

<script>
let page=0;
const tbody=document.querySelector('#table tbody');

async function loadMore(){
  const res=await fetch(`/api/data?page=${page}`);
  const items=await res.json();
  items.forEach(item => {
    const row=document.createElement('tr');
    row.innerHTML=`<td>${item.name}</td><td>${item.value}</td>`;
    tbody.appendChild(row);
  });
  page++;
}

// detect near bottom
window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  if (window.innerHeight + window.scrollY >= document.body.offsetHeight - 100) {
    loadMore();
  }
});

// initial load
loadMore();
</script>
```

### Notes
- For frameworks like React/Angular, use Intersection Observer or dedicated libraries (e.g., `react-infinite-scroll-component`). citeturn0search10  
- For very large datasets, consider virtualization so only visible rows are in the DOM to avoid performance issues. citeturn0search0

Infinite scrolling improves UX for continuously browsed lists but can make it hard for users to find specific content and reach the footer without additional controls. citeturn0search2

## Question

best js library for it

## Answer

Here are some of the **best JavaScript libraries** you can use to build an **infinite-scroll table** (or infinite-scroll data grid), depending on your stack and needs:

### 🧰 General / Vanilla JS
- **Infinite Scroll (metafizzy/infinite-scroll)** – Simple, framework-agnostic plugin that loads more items as you scroll, works well for lists/tables with AJAX data. citeturn0search9

### 🧠 Framework-agnostic table/grids (more powerful)
These aren’t “infinite scroll only” but support it (or can with plugins/config):
- **ag-Grid** – Enterprise-grade grid with infinite scrolling, virtualization, and lots of table features. citeturn0search2
- **Webix DataTable** – UI library with dynamic data loading and optional infinite scroll/data loading. citeturn0search22

### ⚛️ React-focused (if using React)
- **react-infinite-scroll-component** – Lightweight infinite scroll component for lists/tables. citeturn0search14
- **react-window** + **react-window-infinite-loader** – Virtualized list + infinite loading for huge datasets (very performant). citeturn0search14
- **react-virtualized** – Advanced library with list/grid virtualization and infinite loading capabilities. citeturn0search14

### 🔄 Angular
- **ngx-infinite-scroll** – Angular directive for infinite scrolling. citeturn0search17

## 📌 Quick Picks — Best Fit by Use Case

| Use Case | Best Option |
|----------|-------------|
| **Simple vanilla JS infinite scroll** | **Infinite Scroll (metafizzy)** citeturn0search9 |
| **Full-featured data grid with infinite loading** | **ag-Grid** citeturn0search2 |
| **React app with huge dataset** | **react-window + infinite-loader** citeturn0search14 |
| **Quick React infinite list** | **react-infinite-scroll-component** citeturn0search14 |
| **Angular project** | **ngx-infinite-scroll** citeturn0search17 |

If you tell me your framework (plain JS, React, Vue, Angular) and whether you need **virtualization** (for millions of rows), I can tailor a specific recommendation with example code.

## Question

like tanstack etc

## Answer

Here are the **top JavaScript/React libraries** you can use for an **infinite-scroll table**, especially if you want something *like TanStack-style tooling (headless + virtualized + scroll fetching)*:

---

## 🚀 Best Libraries for Infinite Scroll Tables

### **1) TanStack (modern, headless, flexible)**

image_group{"layout":"carousel","aspect_ratio":"1:1","query":["TanStack Table React code","TanStack Virtual infinite scroll","@tanstack/react-table example","@tanstack/virtual list"]}

- **@tanstack/table** – Headless table logic (sorting, filtering, pagination). Doesn’t include UI but gives full control over markup and behavior. citeturn0search8  
- **@tanstack/virtual** – Headless virtualization engine to render *only visible rows*, crucial for high-performance infinite scroll. citeturn0search12  
- Combine with **@tanstack/react-query** (useInfiniteQuery) for data fetching. citeturn0search1  
- Official examples include *virtualized infinite scrolling tables* with TanStack. citeturn0search10

**Best for:** Custom UIs, lightweight bundles, full control (React, Vue, Solid).  
**Trade-offs:** You must wire up your own table structure + scroll triggers.

---

### **2) Material/Mantine React Table + TanStack under the hood**

- Libraries like **Material React Table** or **Mantine React Table** build an opinionated UI on top of TanStack Table but still support infinite scroll via useInfiniteQuery + virtualization. citeturn0search1turn0search9  
- Useful if you want fewer UI decisions to make yourself.

**Best for:** React with styled, feature-rich tables and infinite scroll.

---

## 💪 Full-featured Data Grid Libraries (less headless)

If you want **infinite scrolling + virtualization + table features out of the box**, consider:

### **3) AG Grid**

- Enterprise-grade grid with built-in infinite scroll (server/client), column/row virtualization, sorting, filtering. citeturn0search3  
- Enterprise features are paid but the Community edition still has powerful capabilities.

**Best for:** Large datasets (>100k rows), complex grids, minimal custom wiring.

---

### **4) MUI X Data Grid**

- Supports virtualization and can be extended with infinite scroll logic. citeturn0search13  
- Offers built-in UI, column features, accessibility.

**Best for:** React apps needing polished UI + decent performance.

---

### **5) Other (React)**

- **React Virtualized / React Window + Infinite Loader** – older but battle-tested virtualization + infinite scroll combos. citeturn0search2  
- **React-infinite-scroll-component** – simple infinite scroll for lists or table-like UIs. citeturn0search22

---

## 🧠 When to Pick What

| Need | Recommendation |
|------|--------------|
| **Max control, lightweight, custom UI** | **TanStack Table + TanStack Virtual + React Query** |
| **Headless virtualization only** | **@tanstack/virtual** |
| **Fast enterprise grid with features** | **AG Grid** |
| **Styled React table with ready UI** | **Material/M
