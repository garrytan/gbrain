## Question

Hey dog, I'm looking to work on our landing page design and I'm curious as to what the best way to do this would be in trying to look at design iterations and stuff. And I'm curious if it's better for me to spin up a separate path on the default domain, so it would be like slash homepage2 or something like that, just to like view in the browser the work that AI agents do on the coding and the redesign. Or if it would be better for me to like section by section do feature flags with Statig and then how complicated is it to like turn those flags on and off to see? And then should I use the Versal toolbar to like turn flags on and off? And then if I do that, do I have to use the flags SDK from Versal or can I use that with just normal statig SDK? And then finally, I'm trying to maintain static site generation, SSR, ISR, PPR across the board so that there's no performance degradation as a result of the flags. Is that going to be problematic if I decide to like flag sections of the marketin

## Answer

Mr. White — for *landing page design iteration* (where you mainly want safe visual review + fast ship), the best default is:

## 1) Use PR → Vercel Preview Deployments for iterations (primary workflow)
**Why this wins:**
- Zero risk to production.
- No local dev server needed: every PR gets a shareable URL.
- Works perfectly with SSG/ISR/PPR/SSR because it’s just “a different deployment,” not runtime branching.

**How to use it for design iteration:**
- Each redesign iteration lives on its own PR (or stacked PRs).
- Review in-browser on the preview URL, share with the team, collect notes, merge when ready.

This is the simplest “don’t break what’s working” workflow, and it scales extremely well with “ship many times a day.”

## 2) Use feature flags for rollout/experiments (secondary workflow)
Flags are best when:
- You want a **safe rollout** (0% → 10% → 50% → 100%).
- You want a **kill switch** without redeploying.
- You want **A/B testing** and measurement.

Vercel’s **Flags SDK** is explicitly designed to work with *any provider* (including Statsig) while integrating with Vercel’s tooling. citeturn0search1turn0search14

## 3) “/homepage2” path vs section flags
### A separate path (e.g. `/homepage2`)
Good when:
- You just need to *see the new page* in prod-like conditions.
- You want it fully static with zero runtime logic.
- You’re okay with an “alternate URL” existing (even if you hide it via robots/auth).

Downsides:
- Easy to accidentally leak/share.
- You end up maintaining two routes and deciding when to swap.

### Section-by-section flags
Good when:
- You want to **gradually introduce blocks** (hero, pricing, testimonials).
- You want rollback for specific sections.
- You want to run experiments on components.

Downsides:
- You must be careful with rendering mode + caching (more below).

## 4) Toolbar flag toggling: do you need Vercel’s SDK?
**If you want to toggle/override flags from the Vercel Toolbar (Flags Explorer), use the Vercel Flags SDK.** It’s the recommended path for Vercel Flags and has automatic integration with Flags Explorer. citeturn0search3turn0search13turn0search14

But: Vercel also built the SDK to work with other providers/custom setups. citeturn0search1turn0search5  
And Vercel’s Toolbar supports managing flags across providers (Statsig included) via overrides. citeturn0search9

**Practical guidance:**
- If you’re already on **Statsig** and like it, keep Statsig as source-of-truth, and use an integration approach that still allows Toolbar overrides where it matters.
- If you want the *tightest* Vercel-native experience for marketing iteration, using **Vercel Flags + Flags SDK** is the cleanest path. citeturn0search10turn0search3
- If your question is “can I only use Statsig SDK and still use the Vercel Toolbar for overrides?” — you *can* use Toolbar overrides with multiple providers, but the smoothest “framework-native + explorer integration” path is Flags SDK. citeturn0search9turn0search3

## Question

Thanks. Option number one actually seems reasonable, but in terms of flagging going forward, because we already have stat sig, should we be using personal SDK on that, or should we use the stat sig server-side SDK, keeping in mind my concerns that you addressed in number five in terms of caching, SSG, ISR, PPR, SSR, without performance segregation? And then, like, what should be the formal workflow moving forward that doesn't, like, regress our shipping speed?

## Answer

Mr. White — given you already have Statsig **and** you care a lot about keeping marketing pages cacheable/static, the default is:

### Use Statsig **Server-side** (or Edge) evaluation for *gating*, and keep the **Client SDK** only for *analytics + post-render UI tweaks*
Statsig themselves position server SDKs as the “more control / business logic” option and client SDKs as “runs on end-user devices.” citeturn0search0turn0search4

Why:
- **Client SDK gating** usually means a client fetch + hydration differences → potential flicker/CLS and you lose the “pure static HTML is the experience” benefit.
- **Server/Edge gating** lets you decide the variant *before* HTML is delivered.

But the real constraint is Next.js rendering/caching:

## How to keep SSG/ISR/PPR “clean” while still using flags
If your page (or any server component it renders) reads **cookies/headers** during render to decide a flag, you risk pushing the route into “dynamic” behavior and reducing CDN cacheability. Next/Vercel explicitly talk about keeping the smallest part dynamic and using newer rendering models (PPR) to preserve static where possible. citeturn0search12

So your goal is: **don’t access request data in the page render path** for marketing pages.

### The pattern that best matches your goals
**Evaluate flags in routing layer (Middleware / Routing Functions / edge) and pass only the *result* into the render.**  
The Flags SDK docs for “marketing pages” describe exactly this: cookies used for identification are handled in routing functions so the page itself can stay static and never reads cookies. citeturn0search13

If you want this *and* you want great Vercel tooling:

- Use **Vercel Flags SDK + Statsig provider** (`@flags-sdk/statsig`) so Vercel Toolbar / Flags Explorer can see and override flags cleanly. citeturn0search7turn0search19turn0search1  
- Keep Statsig as the system of record; the Flags SDK is the integration surface in your Next app.

Also relevant: Vercel has a documented Statsig + Edge Config integration path, including middleware examples, which is specifically aimed at low-latency edge evaluation. citeturn0search2turn0search18

## What to choose: Statsig Client SDK vs Server-side SDK
### For marketing pages (your case)
- **Prefer server-side/edge evaluation** for the actual “which variant do I render?” decision. citeturn0search0turn0search4
- Use the **client SDK** only if you need:
  - client-side event logging,
  - or flags for purely client-only UI (non-critical, below-the-fold, no SEO impact).

### For app/product pages (logged-in, personalized)
- Server-side SDK is still the default for correctness.
- Client SDK is fine for UI gating where SSR isn’t the primary concern.

## A formal workflow that won’t slow shipping
Here’s a workflow that scales to “multiple prod deploys/day” without regressions:

### 1) Iteration workflow (design + implementation)
- **Every change via PR → Vercel Preview Deployment**
- Review visually on prev

## Question

Okay, but if you're saying that we use this server-side, does that work on Edge? And then if I don't have Flag's SDK, I can't use the Versal toolbar. What would be the most efficient way for us to switch flags, or can I use the Versal toolbar if I'm going completely server-side SDK with StatSig?

## Answer

Mr. White — **“server-side” and “Edge” can work together**, but it depends on *which* “server-side” you mean.

## 1) Does Statsig server-side evaluation work on Edge?
- **Statsig’s classic server SDKs are Node-oriented** and may not be Edge-runtime compatible in many setups (Edge has different runtime constraints).
- If you want **Edge** evaluation on Vercel, the cleanest paths are:
  1) **Vercel’s Statsig ↔ Edge Config integration** (so evaluation/config fetch is edge-friendly). citeturn0search8  
  2) Use **Vercel Flags SDK with the Statsig provider** (`@flags-sdk/statsig`), which is designed for Next.js/edge-style patterns and “flags evaluated on the server.” citeturn0search2turn0search10

So: **yes**, you can do “server-side” flagging *at the Edge*, but don’t assume your existing Node server SDK code will run unchanged in Edge runtime.

## 2) Can you use the Vercel Toolbar without Flags SDK?
**Yes.** Flags Explorer stores overrides in a cookie named `vercel-flag-overrides`.  
- If you use the **Flags SDK**, it “automatically handles” those overrides. citeturn0search11turn0search14  
- If you **don’t** use Flags SDK, you can still use the Toolbar by doing a **manual setup**: read that cookie, decrypt it, and apply the override values in your own flag-evaluation layer. citeturn0search11turn0search9  
Also, Vercel documents that Flags Explorer can work with **any framework/provider/custom setup**. citeturn0search7turn0search3

**Translation:** You *can* stay “Statsig server-side only” and still use the Toolbar, but you’ll be writing the “respect Toolbar overrides” glue yourself unless you adopt Flags SDK.

## 3) Most efficient way to switch flags (fast iteration + safe rollout)
### For QA / review (per-session, no impact on others)
- Use **Vercel Toolbar → Flags Explorer overrides** on **Preview Deployments**.  
  This is designed for short feedback loops and stores overrides in a cookie. citeturn0search9turn0search3

### For real rollout (actual users)
- Use **Statsig Console** to manage targeting / percent rollout / kill switch (your real control plane).

## 4) What I’d implement with your “keep marketing pages fast/static” requirement
**Best-practice setup:**
1) **Preview Deployments for design iteration** (no flags needed until you’re near launch).
2) For launch/rollout: evaluate flags **in middleware/edge routing** and keep the marketing page render path as static as possible (avoid request-based reads inside the page). The Flags SDK marketing-pages guide is specifically built around this idea. citeturn0search14turn0search2
3) If you want Toolbar overrides with minimal engineering overhead: **use Flags SDK + Statsig provider** (it auto-respects the Toolbar cookie). citeturn0search11turn0search2  
   If you refuse Flags SDK: implement manual cookie override handling. citeturn0search11turn0search7

**My recommendation for “most efficient”:** Flags SDK + Statsig provider, because it gives you:
- Edge/server-o

## Question

Yeah, we're on Next 16.1 app router, React 19.2, and we are SSG on most of the marketing and PPR across the app. And we are on Versal.

## Answer

Mr. White — with **Next 16.1 App Router + React 19.2 + mostly SSG marketing + PPR across the app on Vercel**, here’s the cleanest setup that keeps performance/caching intact *and* gives you fast flag switching.

## Does “server-side” work on Edge?
Yes—**if you evaluate flags in the Edge layer (middleware/routing), not inside the page render path**.

That’s exactly what the Flags SDK “marketing pages” guide is about: keep marketing pages static/CDN-served while still running flags by doing the “identify user / read overrides cookie” work in routing functions, not in the page itself. citeturn0search1

Also: Next’s current model (Cache Components / PPR) is designed to keep routes prerendered unless you pull request-specific APIs into the render chain. citeturn0search3turn0search6

## Toolbar question: can you use Vercel Toolbar without Flags SDK?
Yes.

- The Toolbar’s Flags Explorer sets an encrypted cookie called **`vercel-flag-overrides`**. If you use the **Flags SDK**, overrides are handled automatically. citeturn0search2turn0search4turn0search17
- If you **don’t** use Flags SDK, you *can still use the Toolbar*, but you must **manually read + decrypt** that cookie and apply overrides in your own evaluation layer. citeturn0search2turn0search17

So the efficiency trade:
- **Most efficient (least custom glue):** Flags SDK (Next) + Statsig provider → automatic Toolbar override support. citeturn0search4turn0search7
- **Pure Statsig server-side without Flags SDK:** doable, but you’ll be writing/maintaining the override-cookie integration yourself. citeturn0search2

## What I’d do in your stack (fast shipping, no caching regressions)

### 1) Marketing pages (SSG): keep them static
**Goal:** never force the marketing route to become dynamic.

**Pattern:**
- Evaluate flags at **Edge (middleware)** and set a simple decision (rewrite to variant route, or set a lightweight header/cookie for the *client* only if needed).
- Render remains SSG and CDN-cacheable because the page itself isn’t calling request APIs.

This is the intended “marketing pages + flags” pattern. citeturn0search1

**Implementation choice:**
- Use **Flags SDK + Statsig provider** (recommended) so:
  - middleware-compatible,
  - Toolbar overrides “just work,”
  - flags are typed and defined in code. citeturn0search4turn0search7turn0search2

### 2) App routes (PPR): allow personalization without blowing up the whole page
PPR is meant to combine static shell + dynamic islands. Keep “flag/personalization” confined to the dynamic parts. citeturn0search6turn0search3

## The formal workflow going forward (won’t slow shipping)
**A. Iterate**
- PR → **Vercel Preview Deployments** for every design/copy iteration.
- Use Toolbar overrides on preview URLs for quick review.

**B. Ship behind 1 release flag**
- For a landing redesign, start with a single top-level flag (`newLanding`) rather than many section flags.
- Internally, structure the code so the “new landing” ca
