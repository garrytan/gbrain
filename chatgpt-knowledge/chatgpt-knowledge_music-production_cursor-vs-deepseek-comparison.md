## Question

cursor vs deepseek

## Answer

For coding specifically, this is the practical breakdown:

| Category | entity["company","Cursor","AI code editor"] Composer 2.5 | entity["company","DeepSeek","V4 Pro model"] V4 Pro |
|---|---|---|
| Raw model quality | Near GPT-5.5 / Opus 4.7 on many coding benchmarks | Very strong open model, slightly below top closed models |
| Agent workflows | Excellent | Excellent |
| Large refactors | Excellent | Very good |
| Terminal-heavy tasks | Weaker than GPT-5.5 | Very good |
| Cost | Cheap | Extremely cheap |
| Context window | 200k–1M depending on mode | 1M |
| IDE integration | Best-in-class inside Cursor | Depends on harness |
| Self-hosting | No | Open-weight / flexible |
| Best use case | Daily coding in Cursor | Always-on agents, background automation, cost-sensitive workloads |

Benchmark reports currently show Composer 2.5 roughly matching Claude Opus 4.7 and GPT-5.5 on SWE-Bench-style coding tasks while being dramatically cheaper. GPT-5.5 still leads on terminal-heavy autonomous workflows. citeturn0search0turn0search15

DeepSeek V4 Pro is currently one of the strongest open models for coding and agentic workflows, with a 1M-token context window and significantly lower API pricing than most frontier models. citeturn0news34turn0search8

### For Jovie

Your stack is unusual because you're running:

- Hermes
- Conductor
- Always-on MacBook Air agents
- OpenRouter routing
- Background cron jobs
- Cost-sensitive automation

For that setup:

**Best daily coding**
1. Cursor + Composer 2.5 Fast
2. GPT-5.5 for hard terminal/debugging tasks
3. Claude Opus for architecture reviews

**Best always-on agent**
1. DeepSeek V4 Pro
2. DeepSeek V4 Flash
3. Qwen-based fallback

**Best cost/performance**
1. DeepSeek V4 Pro
2. Composer 2.5 Standard
3. GPT-5.5 Mini/Medium tiers

### Cost reality

Approximate API pricing per 1M tokens:

| Model | Input | Output |
|---|---:|---:|
| Composer 2.5 Standard | $0.50 | $2.50 |
| Composer 2.5 Fast | $3.00 | $15.00 |
| DeepSeek V4 Pro | ~$0.43 | ~$0.87 |
| GPT-5.5 | ~$2.50–30 | ~$15–180 |
| Claude Opus 4.7 | ~$15 | ~$75 |

citeturn0search0turn0search3turn0search18

For your specific use case, I would run:

- Cursor Composer 2.5 Fast for active development
- DeepSeek V4 Pro for Hermes agents
- GPT-5.5 only when the task is terminal-heavy, CI-heavy, or a critical production fix

That gives you roughly 80–90% of frontier-model performance while keeping agent costs low enough to run continuously. citeturn0search0turn0news32

## Question

is a codex 200/mo sub cheaper?

## Answer

Yes. If you're a heavy user, the $200/month Codex Pro subscription is usually dramatically cheaper than paying raw API costs for equivalent usage. citeturn0search20turn0news32

For your usage pattern specifically:

- Long-running coding agents
- Large context windows
- Frequent GPT-5.5 usage
- Multiple parallel sessions
- Hermes/Conductor workflows
- Daily coding

A $200 Codex subscription is hard to beat on pure dollars-per-token.

Rough comparison:

| Usage Pattern | Codex $200 Pro | API |
|---|---:|---:|
| Casual dev | Worse value | Better |
| 2–4 hrs/day coding | Similar | Similar |
| 6–10 hrs/day coding | Better | Much better |
| Always-on autonomous agents | Depends | Often API wins |
| Massive background automation | API | Better |

The key distinction:

- **Interactive coding** → subscription wins.
- **Background agents running 24/7** → API/OpenRouter usually wins.

For Jovie, I would not replace your DeepSeek/OpenRouter infrastructure with Codex subscriptions.

I would do:

- MBP active development → Codex Pro $200
- Cursor Composer 2.5 for IDE workflows
- MacBook Air always-on agents → DeepSeek V4 Pro/Flash via OpenRouter
- GPT-5.5 API only for escalation paths

That hybrid setup is usually the cheapest way to get frontier-model quality where it matters while avoiding burning subscription limits on autonomous jobs.

The reason is simple: subscriptions subsidize human-driven usage. Autonomous agents can consume absurd amounts of tokens. OpenClaw reportedly burned through the equivalent of millions in token value running large fleets of coding agents, which is exactly the type of workload subscriptions are designed to limit. citeturn0news30turn0search14

For you personally, if you're coding 8–12 hours/day and constantly hitting limits in Cursor/Claude, the $200 Codex plan is probably one of the highest ROI subscriptions you can buy right now. citeturn0search20turn0search15

## Question

claude 200/mo?

## Answer

For your use case, the urlClaude Max Planturn0search1 at $200/month is arguably a better value than Codex Pro if your workload is primarily:

- Large codebase refactors
- Agent-driven coding
- Architecture planning
- Multi-file edits
- Long-context repository work
- Claude Code terminal workflows

Anthropic's $200 tier gives roughly **20× Pro usage**, includes Claude Code, and is explicitly targeted at developers running Claude all day. citeturn0search1turn0search6turn0news17

For Jovie specifically:

| Workflow | Winner |
|---|---|
| Large repo coding | Claude Max |
| Long architecture discussions | Claude Max |
| Agent teams | Claude Max |
| Terminal coding | Claude Max |
| Autonomous coding sessions | Claude Max |
| Deep reasoning | Claude Max |
| Multimodal / broader AI tooling | Codex Pro |
| Unlimited-feeling usage | Codex Pro |
| Voice / ecosystem features | Codex Pro |

The important caveat:

**Claude Max is not unlimited.**

It operates on rolling usage windows and additional caps. Heavy agentic workflows can still hit limits. citeturn0search12turn0search13turn0search10

Codex Pro's advantage is that OpenAI tends to give a much more "just keep working" experience for interactive use. Claude Max gives you a larger bucket, but it is still a bucket. citeturn0search9turn0search7

For your stack, if forced to pick one:

1. Claude Max $200
2. Cursor Composer 2.5
3. DeepSeek V4 Pro for always-on agents

That combination probably gives the highest coding throughput per dollar right now.

The setup I would personally optimize for:

- Claude Max $200 on the MBP
- DeepSeek V4 Pro via OpenRouter on the MacBook Air
- Hermes/Conductor orchestration
- GPT-5.5 only as an escalation model for difficult debugging or production incidents

That minimizes API burn while keeping frontier-level coding quality available almost continuously. citeturn0search1turn0search4turn0search11

## Question

compare them all. what makes the most sense

## Answer

For **your exact situation** — solo founder, Jovie, agent-heavy workflows, limited runway, always-on automation, large codebase, Conductor/Hermes/GBrain — I would rank them like this:

# Overall Ranking

| Rank | Option | Value For You |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Claude Max $200 + DeepSeek agents | Best overall |
| 2 | Cursor + Composer 2.5 + DeepSeek agents | Best cost/performance |
| 3 | Codex Pro $200 + DeepSeek agents | Best OpenAI workflow |
| 4 | Pure GPT-5.5 API | Best quality, worst economics |
| 5 | Pure Claude API | Strong but expensive |
| 6 | Pure Cursor Ultra | Doesn't solve always-on agent problem |

# The Mistake Most People Make

They try to pick one.

You should not pick one.

You have two fundamentally different workloads:

### Workload A

Tim coding.

Needs:

- reasoning
- architecture
- product decisions
- shipping

Winner:

**Claude Max**

### Workload B

Company robots.

Needs:

- cheap
- always-
