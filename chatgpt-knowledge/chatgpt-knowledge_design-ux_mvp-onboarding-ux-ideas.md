## Question

Hey, so I'm building JOV, obviously, which I think you know, and, you know, Linkin.io for music industry that is designed to be high-converting, and specifically for the music industry. So, I guess my question right now is, as I'm... Target demo is music creators specifically music creators who previously are spending money to drive traffic to Lincoln bio or a link fire or smart link thing and then you know from there are are arch so they’re driving traffic from Lincoln Bay or whatever and then they’re going and then they have a Spotify account right they have some kind of you know following over so be able to drive traffic from social so that’s what we’re kind of like looking at right now and I’m just trying to think of like I guess the main question is so I’m thinking about like on boarding and just generally for the MVP. I’m only sending I’m creating all the profiles from scratch and then on behalf of the client and then sending them a link to a finished profile that they can claim 

## Answer

Mr. White,

Here’s the straight, product-focused take—grounded in conversion, UX friction, and MVP reality.

---

## 1. **“We build it for you, then they claim it” (Concierge onboarding)**
**Very good idea for MVP.**  
This is exactly right for your target user *today*.

**Why it works**
- Music creators already pay to *send traffic*, not to *configure software*.
- You remove the #1 drop-off point: blank-state paralysis.
- “Here’s your finished page” → instant value → higher activation.
- You learn *what actually matters* before productizing assumptions.

**Keep this as:**
- MVP / early access
- Paid tiers
- White-glove upsell

Do **not** throw this away when self-serve launches. Keep it as a feature.

---

## 2. **Forcing Spotify or Apple Music during signup**
**Good idea conceptually, bad if enforced too early.**

### The correct rule:
**Require at least ONE “primary destination,” not a specific platform.**

Why:
- Spotify-first makes sense for *most*, but:
  - Some creators are YouTube-first
  - Some are unreleased / pre-launch
  - Some are DJ / SoundCloud-centric
- Hard forcing increases signup abandonment.

### Better implementation:
During onboarding:
> “What’s the ONE place you most want fans to go?”

Options:
- Spotify
- Apple Music
- YouTube
- SoundCloud
- Website
- “I’ll add it later” (soft escape hatch)

Then:
- Strongly *recommend* Spotify/Apple if detected later
- Nudge, don’t block

**Rule of thumb:**  
> Never hard-gate revenue traffic tools unless legally required.

## 3. **AI chat as the main dashboard**
**Bad idea. Do not do this.**

AI-only dashboards fail because:
- Editing links is a *spatial task*, not a conversational one
- Users want to *scan*, *drag*, *toggle*
- Chat hides system state
- Power users hate it

**This will increase cognitive load, not reduce it.**

### Correct pattern:
- **Traditional dashboard = source of truth**
- **AI = assistant, not interface**

Example:
- Dashboard shows links, analytics, buttons
- AI sits in a side panel:
  - “Add my new single everywhere”
  - “Optimize this page for conversions”
  - “Why did my Spotify clicks drop?”

---

## 4. **AI chat for onboarding**
**Yes — this is where AI shines.**

Chat-based onboarding is **excellent** *if* you do one thing right:

> **The chat must build a visible page in real time.**

### Best-in-class flow:
- Left: chat (“What platforms do you use?”)
- Right: live preview updating instantly
- User *sees* progress, not just answers questions

This gives you:
- Low intimidation
- High completion
- Perceived intelligence
- Emotional momentum

### Critical rules:
- Always show progress (“3/5 steps done”)
- Allow skipping
- Allow post-onboarding edits via normal UI

---

## 5. **Hybrid model (this is the correct answer)**
You want **AI-first**, not **AI-only**.

### The winning stack:
- **Chat onboarding** → fast, friendly, guided
- **Visual dashboard** → precise, controllable, scalable
- **AI actions** → shortcuts, bulk edits, insights

Think:
- Notion +

## Question

Clerk free account gets sub domains free? Or paid add on?

## Answer

Short answer: **Clerk’s free plan *does* let you use a custom domain or subdomain at no cost.** You don’t pay extra just to point a domain/subdomain at your Clerk auth pages. citeturn0search0turn0search10

**Key points:**
- The **Free plan ($0)** includes core auth features, pre-built components, and support for a **custom domain** (i.e., you can use your own domain/subdomain for hosted auth flows). citeturn0search0turn0search10  
- This isn’t a paid add-on — you can configure your own domain/subdomain in the free tier. citeturn0search0  
- Advanced multi-domain or satellite domain features may require paid plans or add-ons for production, depending on your setup. citeturn0search2

So if what you mean is “can I run auth on *auth.myapp.com* on the free plan?” — **yes**, that’s included. citeturn0search0  

If you need multiple domains or advanced domain features in production, those can be tied to paid plan capabilities. citeturn0search2

## Question

Subdomain and main domain?

## Answer

Mr. White,

**Yes — but with an important limit.**

### Clerk Free Plan (production)
- ✅ **1 primary custom domain** (e.g. `jov.link`)
- ❌ **Multiple production domains / subdomains** → **not included**

So on free you can have **either**:
- `auth.jov.link` **or**
- `jov.link`

…but **not both as separate production domains**.

### When you can use both
- **Dev / preview environments** can use additional Clerk-provided subdomains (e.g. `your-app.clerk.accounts.dev`) → free
- **Satellite / multiple production domains** (e.g. `jov.link` + `artists.jov.link`) → **paid plan**

### Practical recommendation for JOV / Linkin.io
For MVP:
- Use **one auth domain** like `auth.jov.link`
- Serve all creator pages on other subdomains without Clerk directly attached

Upgrade **only when**:
- You need multiple branded auth domains
- You’re running true multi-tenant custom domains at scale

**Bottom line:**  
Free = **1 production domain total**.  
Main + subdomain together = **paid**.

If you want, I can suggest the cleanest domain architecture for creator pages vs auth so you don’t pay early.
