# Changelog

All notable changes to MBrain will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.2] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **`mbrain setup-agent --claude` now installs the session-end stop hook automatically.** A new bash hook (`~/.claude/scripts/hooks/stop-mbrain-check.sh` + `lib/mbrain-relevance.sh`) gets written, registered in `~/.claude/settings.json` as `stop:mbrain-check`, and shipped with a skip-dirs template. When a Claude Code session ends, the hook emits a `block` decision that forces one final memory check: write durable session-derived knowledge back to the brain when there is something worth saving, or explicitly say `MBRAIN-PASS: <reason>`. Re-entry is guarded by Claude Code's native `stop_hook_active` field, and the gate respects `MBRAIN_STOP_HOOK=0`, `~/.claude/mbrain-skip-dirs`, and missing-CLI fail-closed. Re-runs of `setup-agent` upsert a single registration (idempotent).

### Fixed

- **`mbrain init --help` no longer creates a brain as a side effect.** The init command used to fall through its flag checks when `--help`/`-h` was passed, silently bootstrapping a PGLite brain and overwriting `~/.mbrain/config.json`. It now prints usage and exits 0 without touching config or data.
- **Incremental sync no longer advances the git checkpoint after partial import failure.** Syncable markdown files that are rejected by import validation now make `mbrain sync` fail before writing `sync.last_commit`, so fixing the file and rerunning sync retries the same git range.
- **Renaming a durable page to an unsyncable resolver path now removes the old page.** A rename such as `people/alice.md -> people/README.md` is treated as a page deletion instead of an ignored diff that leaves stale data in the brain.
- **Full import and incremental sync now use the same page filter.** `mbrain import` skips resolver/meta markdown such as `README.md`, `schema.md`, `index.md`, `log.md`, `ops/`, hidden paths, and `.raw/` sidecars, matching the incremental sync policy.
- **The default test script now gives PGLite-heavy tests enough time to finish.** `bun run test` uses a 20s per-test timeout instead of Bun's 5s default, avoiding false negatives from local embedded database startup and migration work.

### Changed

- **Version metadata now reports `0.10.2`.** `VERSION`, `package.json`, and `skills/manifest.json` are aligned so `mbrain --version` and the skills manifest describe the same release.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-04-17

Historical note: this release was the last selective import from upstream
`garrytan/gbrain` before the project moved under the independent `mbrain`
identity. It does NOT include upstream's v0.10 GStackBrain skill
architecture, v0.10.1 autopilot/extract/features, or the full v0.9.x
smart-file-storage / community-fix wave. Those decisions are preserved in
`docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md` as upstream provenance, not as an ongoing release
policy.

### Added

- **Four deterministic brain-quality tools, engine-agnostic.** `mbrain publish` renders a brain page as a self-contained, password-protectable (AES-256-GCM) HTML share. `mbrain check-backlinks check|fix` enforces the Iron Law of Back-Linking across a brain directory. `mbrain lint` flags LLM preambles, stray code fences, placeholder dates, and missing frontmatter (`--fix` auto-cleans). `mbrain report --type` saves timestamped reports to `brain/reports/{type}/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`. All four need no database connection and work identically on SQLite, PGLite, and Postgres. Ported from upstream with security hardening already rolled in.
- **Cross-cutting brain filing rules.** New `skills/_brain-filing-rules.md` is now referenced from every brain-writing skill — file by primary subject, not format; bulk data to `sources/`, analysis to the subject directory; notability gate before creating entities; iron law of back-linking.
- **Upstream sync log.** `docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md` records which upstream commits this project has adopted, explicitly skipped (and why), or deferred. Future cherry-pick decisions start here.

### Changed

- **Sub-agents now know when to use your brain.** The MCP server ships an `instructions` string that tells every connected agent — main or sub-agent — when to prefer MBrain over web search or codebase grep, and when not to. The old reliance on CLAUDE.md triggers alone was fragile for spawned sub-agents; the trigger now travels with the protocol.
- **Core tool descriptions now say WHY, not just WHAT.** `search`, `query`, `get_page`, and `put_page` descriptions are rewritten with trigger context ("use BEFORE Grep or WebSearch when the question involves a named entity", "compiled truth + timeline"), so agents pick the right tool at the decision point instead of defaulting to grep.
- **Agent rules trimmed to protocol only.** `MBRAIN_AGENT_RULES.md` Section 2 no longer duplicates the "when to use" trigger now served by MCP instructions — it keeps only the step-by-step lookup protocol, cutting noise in the injected ruleset.
- **`add_link` now advertises its full link-type surface.** The MCP description and `link_type` param doc list both people/deal types (`invested_in`, `works_at`, `founded`) and the technical knowledge-map types (`implements`, `depends_on`, `extends`, `contradicts`, `layer_of`, `prerequisite_for`), so agents linking a concept to a system at the decision point see technical types as first-class instead of guessing.
- **Battle-tested skill patterns from production.** `skills/enrich`, `skills/ingest`, `skills/maintain`, `skills/briefing`, and `skills/query` pulled in the 7-step enrichment protocol, citation precedence rules, media ingest flows, back-link enforcement prompts, and search-quality diagnostics from upstream's v0.8.1 era. The project's Technical Concept Queries section in `query/SKILL.md` is preserved and now sits alongside the new Citation in Answers + Search Quality Awareness guidance.
- **Voice and X-to-Brain recipes refreshed with production lessons.** `recipes/twilio-voice-brain.md` and `recipes/x-to-brain.md` now document unicode-crash fix, PII scrubbing, identity-first prompts, Filtered Stream integration, tweet rating rubric, and cron staggering.
- **Version metadata now reports one coherent `0.10.1` release.** `VERSION`, `package.json`, and `skills/manifest.json` all report `0.10.1` so `mbrain --version` and the skills manifest describe the same release.

### Source attribution

This release backports the following upstream commits verbatim or by file:

- `1e6d7e3` (upstream v0.8.1 era) — battle-tested skill patterns
- `80d00e7` — add `_brain-filing-rules.md` to CLAUDE.md key files
- `edc2174` + `87bb2a5` — `mbrain publish` + XSS/TUS/path-traversal hardening
- `13fca37` + `54fdd4b` + `87bb2a5` — `check-backlinks`, `lint`, `report` + hardening

Full classification (what was skipped, why) lives in `docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md`.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Your brain can now map large codebases before touching source.** `system` pages and `codemap` frontmatter let agents store repo architecture, key entry points, vocabulary differences, and the exact files that implement a concept across multiple systems. Instead of re-orienting from scratch every session, the agent can read the map first and jump straight to the code that matters.
- **New `codemap-ingest` skill + templates.** Agents now have a dedicated workflow for turning code exploration into reusable `systems/` and `concepts/` pages, with templates for both page shapes and explicit pointer-verification discipline.

### Changed

- **Brain-first lookup now applies to technical questions too.** The compact agent rules, SKILLPACK, query skill, and supporting guides now tell agents to check `concepts/` and `systems/` before broad repo search, and to write back verified code pointers when they discover reusable structure.
- **`codemap` data is now searchable instead of decorative.** Technical frontmatter is indexed into page search, imported as dedicated `frontmatter` chunks for hybrid retrieval, and migrated into existing installs so symbol/path lookups can find the right page before broad repo search.
- **Upgrade refresh now updates agent rules too.** `mbrain upgrade` now reruns `mbrain setup-agent --skip-mcp` after a successful install so Codex/Claude clients pick up new brain rules without unexpectedly changing MCP registration.

### Fixed

- **Timestamp normalization is limited to `codemap.verified_at`.** Parsing no longer rewrites unrelated frontmatter timestamps just because gray-matter produced a `Date`, which avoids accidental UTC coercion and needless content churn.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Your AI can answer the phone now.** Voice-to-brain v0.8.0 ships 25 production patterns from a real deployment. WebRTC works in a browser tab with just an OpenAI key, phone number via Twilio is optional. Your agent picks its own name and personality. Pre-computed engagement bids mean it greets you with something specific ("dude, your social radar caught something wild today"), not "how can I help you?" Context-first prompts, proactive advisor mode, caller routing, dynamic noise suppression, stuck watchdog, thinking sounds during tool calls. This is the "Her" experience, out of the box.
- **Upgrade = feature discovery.** When you upgrade to v0.8.0, the CLI tells you what's new and your agent offers to set up voice immediately. WebRTC-first (zero setup), then asks about a phone number. Migration files now have YAML frontmatter with `feature_pitch` so every future version can pitch its headline feature through the upgrade flow.
- **Remote MCP simplified.** The Supabase Edge Function deployment is gone. Remote MCP now uses a self-hosted server + ngrok tunnel. Simpler, more reliable, works with any AI client. All `docs/mcp/` guides updated to reflect the actual production architecture.

### Changed

- **Voice recipe is now 25 production patterns deep.** Identity separation, pre-computed bid system, context-first prompts, proactive advisor mode, conversation timing (the #1 fix), no-repetition rule, radical prompt compression (13K to 4.7K tokens), OpenAI Realtime Prompting Guide structure, auth-before-speech, brain escalation, stuck watchdog, never-hang-up rule, thinking sounds, fallback TwiML, tool set architecture, trusted user auth, caller routing, dynamic VAD, on-screen debug UI, live moment capture, belt-and-suspenders post-call, mandatory 3-step post-call, WebRTC parity, dual API event handling, report-aware query routing.
- **WebRTC session pseudocode updated.** Native FormData, `tools` in session config, `type: 'realtime'` on all session.update calls. WebRTC transcription NOT supported over data channel (use Whisper post-call).
- **MCP docs rewritten.** All per-client guides (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cowork, Perplexity) updated from Edge Function URLs to self-hosted + ngrok pattern.

### Removed

- **Supabase Edge Function MCP deployment.** `scripts/deploy-remote.sh`, `supabase/functions/mbrain-mcp/`, `src/edge-entry.ts`, `.env.production.example`, `docs/mcp/CHATGPT.md` all removed. The Edge Function never worked reliably. Self-hosted + ngrok is the path.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Your brain now runs locally with zero infrastructure.** PGLite (Postgres 17.5 compiled to WASM) gives you the exact same search quality as Supabase, same pgvector HNSW, same pg_trgm fuzzy matching, same tsvector full-text search. No server, no subscription, no API keys needed for keyword search. `mbrain init` and you're running in 2 seconds.
- **Smart init defaults to local.** `mbrain init` now creates a PGLite brain by default. If your repo has 1000+ markdown files, it suggests Supabase for scale. `--supabase` and `--pglite` flags let you choose explicitly.
- **Migrate between engines anytime.** `mbrain migrate --to supabase` transfers your entire brain (pages, chunks, embeddings, tags, links, timeline) to remote Postgres with manifest-based resume. `mbrain migrate --to pglite` goes the other way. Embeddings copy directly, no re-embedding needed.
- **Pluggable engine factory.** `createEngine()` dynamically loads the right engine from config. PGLite WASM is never loaded for Postgres users.
- **Search works without OpenAI.** `hybridSearch` now checks for `OPENAI_API_KEY` before attempting embeddings. No key = keyword-only search. No more crashes when you just want to search your local brain.
- **Your brain gets new senses automatically.** Integration recipes teach your agent how to wire up voice calls, email, Twitter, and calendar into your brain. Run `mbrain integrations` to see what's available. Your agent reads the recipe, asks for API keys, validates each one, and sets everything up. Markdown is code -- the recipe IS the installer.
- **Voice-to-brain: phone calls create brain pages.** The first recipe: Twilio + OpenAI Realtime voice agent. Call a number, talk, and a structured brain page appears with entity detection, cross-references, and a summary posted to your messaging app. Opinionated defaults: caller screening, brain-first lookup, quiet hours, thinking sounds. The smoke test calls YOU (outbound) so you experience the magic immediately.
- **`mbrain integrations` command.** Six subcommands for managing integration recipes: `list` (dashboard of senses + reflexes), `show` (recipe details), `status` (credential checks with direct links to get missing keys), `doctor` (health checks), `stats` (signal analytics), `test` (recipe validation). `--json` on every subcommand for agent-parseable output. No database connection needed.
- **Health heartbeat.** Integrations log events to `~/.mbrain/integrations/<id>/heartbeat.jsonl`. Status checks detect stale integrations and include diagnostic steps.
- **17 individually linkable SKILLPACK guides.** The 1,281-line monolith is now broken into standalone guides at `docs/guides/`, organized by category. Each guide is individually searchable and linkable. The SKILLPACK index stays at the same URL (backward compatible).
- **"Getting Data In" documentation.** New `docs/integrations/` with a landing page, recipe format documentation, credential gateway guide, and meeting webhook guide. Explains the deterministic collector pattern: code for data, LLMs for judgment.
- **Architecture and philosophy docs.** `docs/architecture/infra-layer.md` documents the shared foundation (import, chunk, embed, search). `docs/ethos/THIN_HARNESS_FAT_SKILLS.md` is Garry's essay on the architecture philosophy with an agent decision guide. `docs/designs/HOMEBREW_FOR_PERSONAL_AI.md` maps the 10-star vision.

### Changed

- **Engine interface expanded.** Added `runMigration()` (replaces internal driver access for schema migrations) and `getChunksWithEmbeddings()` (loads embedding data for cross-engine migration).
- **Shared utilities extracted.** `validateSlug`, `contentHash`, and row mappers moved from `postgres-engine.ts` to `src/core/utils.ts`. Both engines share them.
- **Config infers engine type.** If `database_path` is set but `engine` is missing, config now infers `pglite` instead of defaulting to `postgres`.
- **Import serializes on PGLite.** Parallel workers are Postgres-only. PGLite uses sequential import (single-connection architecture).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- **Import no longer silently drops files with "..." in the name.** The path traversal check rejected any filename containing two consecutive dots, killing 1.2% of files in real-world corpora (YouTube transcripts, TED talks, podcast titles). Now only rejects actual traversal patterns like `../`. Community fix wave, 8 contributors.
- **Import no longer crashes on JavaScript/TypeScript projects.** The file walker crashed on `node_modules` directories and broken symlinks. Now skips `node_modules` and handles broken symlinks gracefully with a warning.
- **`mbrain init` exits cleanly after setup.** Previously hung forever because stdin stayed open. Now pauses stdin after reading input.
- **pgvector extension auto-created during init.** No more copy-pasting SQL into the Supabase editor. `mbrain init` now runs `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` automatically, with a clear fallback message if it can't.
- **Supabase connection string hint matches current dashboard UI.** Updated navigation path to match the 2026 Supabase dashboard layout.
- **Hermes Agent link fixed in README.** Pointed to the correct NousResearch GitHub repo.

### Changed

- **Search is faster.** Keyword search now runs in parallel with the embedding pipeline instead of waiting for it. Saves ~200-500ms per hybrid search call.
- **.mdx files are now importable.** The import walker, sync filter, and slug generator all recognize `.mdx` alongside `.md`.

### Added

- **Community PR wave process** documented in CLAUDE.md for future contributor batches.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **Access your brain from any AI client.** Deploy MBrain as a serverless remote MCP endpoint on your existing Supabase instance. Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cowork, and Perplexity Computer. One URL, bearer token auth, zero new infrastructure. Clone the repo, fill in 3 env vars, run `scripts/deploy-remote.sh`, done.
- **Per-client setup guides** in `docs/mcp/` for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cowork, Perplexity, and ChatGPT (coming soon, requires OAuth 2.1). Also documents Tailscale Funnel and ngrok as self-hosted alternatives.
- **Token management** via standalone `src/commands/auth.ts`. Create, list, revoke per-client bearer tokens. Includes smoke test: `auth.ts test <url> --token <token>` verifies the full pipeline (initialize + tools/list + get_stats) in 3 seconds.
- **Usage logging** via `mcp_request_log` table. Every remote tool call logs token name, operation, latency, and status for debugging and security auditing.
- **Hardened health endpoint** at `/health`. Unauthenticated: 200/503 only (no info disclosure). Authenticated: checks postgres, pgvector, and OpenAI API key status.

### Fixed

- **MCP server actually connects now.** Handler registration used string literals (`'tools/list' as any`) instead of SDK typed schemas. Replaced with `ListToolsRequestSchema` and `CallToolRequestSchema`. Without this fix, `mbrain serve` silently failed to register handlers. (Issue #9)
- **Search results no longer flooded by one large page.** Keyword search returned ALL chunks from matching pages. Now returns one best chunk per page via `DISTINCT ON`. (Issue #22)
- **Search dedup no longer collapses to one chunk per page.** Layer 1 kept only the single highest-scoring chunk per slug. Now keeps top 3, letting later dedup layers (text similarity, cap per page) do their job. (Issue #22)
- **Transactions no longer corrupt shared state.** Both `PostgresEngine.transaction()` and `db.withTransaction()` swapped the shared connection reference, breaking under concurrent use. Now uses scoped engine via `Object.create` with no shared state mutation. (Issue #22)
- **embed --stale no longer wipes valid embeddings.** `upsertChunks()` deleted all chunks then re-inserted, writing NULL for chunks without new embeddings. Now uses UPSERT (INSERT ON CONFLICT UPDATE) with COALESCE to preserve existing embeddings. (Issue #22)
- **Slug normalization is consistent.** `pathToSlug()` preserved case while `inferSlug()` lowercased. Now `validateSlug()` enforces lowercase at the validation layer, covering all entry points. (Issue #22)
- **initSchema no longer reads from disk at runtime.** Both schema loaders used `readFileSync` with `import.meta.url`, which broke in compiled binaries and Deno Edge Functions. Schema is now embedded at build time via `scripts/build-schema.sh`. (Issue #22)
- **file_upload actually uploads content.** The operation wrote DB metadata but never called the storage backend. Fixed in all 3 paths (operation, CLI upload, CLI sync) with rollback semantics. (Issue #22)
- **S3 storage backend authenticates requests.** `signedFetch()` was just unsigned `fetch()`. Replaced with `@aws-sdk/client-s3` for proper SigV4 signing. Supports R2/MinIO via `forcePathStyle`. (Issue #22)
- **Parallel import uses thread-safe queue.** `queue.shift()` had race conditions under parallel workers. Now uses an atomic index counter. Checkpoint preserved on errors for safe resume. (Issue #22)
- **redirect verifies remote existence before deleting local files.** Previously deleted local files unconditionally. Now checks storage backend before removing. (Issue #22)
- **`mbrain call` respects dry_run.** `handleToolCall()` hardcoded `dryRun: false`. Now reads from params. (Issue #22)

### Changed

- Added `@aws-sdk/client-s3` as a dependency for authenticated S3 operations.
- Schema migration v2: unique index on `content_chunks(page_id, chunk_index)` for UPSERT support.
- Schema migration v3: `access_tokens` and `mcp_request_log` tables for remote MCP auth.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- **Apple Notes and files with spaces just work.** Paths like `Apple Notes/2017-05-03 ohmygreen.md` now auto-slugify to clean slugs (`apple-notes/2017-05-03-ohmygreen`). Spaces become hyphens, parens and special characters are stripped, accented characters normalize to ASCII. All 5,861+ Apple Notes files import cleanly without manual renaming.
- **Existing brains auto-migrate.** On first run after upgrade, a one-time migration renames all existing slugs with spaces or special characters to their clean form. Links are rewritten automatically. No manual cleanup needed.
- **Import and sync produce identical slugs.** Both pipelines now use the same `slugifyPath()` function, eliminating the mismatch where sync preserved case but import lowercased.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **Your brain never falls behind.** Live sync keeps the vector DB current with your brain repo automatically. Set up a cron, use `--watch`, hook into GitHub webhooks, or use git hooks. Your agent picks whatever fits its environment. Edit a markdown file, push, and within minutes it's searchable. No more stale embeddings serving wrong answers.
- **Know your install actually works.** New verification runbook (`docs/MBRAIN_VERIFY.md`) catches the silent failures that used to go unnoticed: the pooler bug that skips pages, missing embeddings, stale sync. The real test: push a correction, wait, search for it. If the old text comes back, sync is broken and the runbook tells you exactly why.
- **New installs set up live sync automatically.** The setup skill now includes live sync (Phase H) and full verification (Phase I) as mandatory steps. Agents that install MBrain will configure automatic sync and verify it works before declaring setup complete.
- **Fixes the silent page-skip bug.** If your Supabase connection uses the Transaction mode pooler, sync silently skips most pages. The new docs call this out as a hard prerequisite with a clear fix (switch to Session mode). The verification runbook catches it by comparing page count against file count.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-10

### Changed

- All GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs across test, e2e, and release workflows. Prevents supply chain attacks via mutable version tags.
- Workflow permissions hardened: `contents: read` on test and e2e workflows limits GITHUB_TOKEN blast radius.
- OpenClaw CI install pinned to v2026.4.9 instead of pulling latest.

### Added

- Gitleaks secret scanning CI job runs on every push and PR. Catches accidentally committed API keys, tokens, and credentials.
- `.gitleaks.toml` config with allowlists for test fixtures and example files.
- GitHub Actions SHA maintenance rule in CLAUDE.md so pins stay fresh on every `/ship` and `/review`.
- S3 Sig V4 TODO for future implementation when S3 storage becomes a deployment path.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- `mbrain check-update` command with `--json` output. Checks GitHub Releases for new versions, compares semver (minor+ only, skips patches), fetches and parses changelog diffs. Fail-silent on network errors.
- SKILLPACK Section 17: Auto-Update Notifications. Full agent playbook for the update lifecycle: check, notify, consent, upgrade, skills refresh, schema sync, report. Never auto-upgrades without user permission.
- Standalone SKILLPACK self-update for users who load the skillpack directly without the mbrain CLI. Version markers in SKILLPACK and RECOMMENDED_SCHEMA headers, with raw GitHub URL fetching.
- Step 7 in the OpenClaw install paste: daily update checks, default-on. User opts into being notified about updates, not into automatic installs.
- Setup skill Phase G: conditional auto-update offer for manual install users.
- Schema state tracking via `~/.mbrain/update-state.json`. Tracks which recommended schema directories the user adopted, declined, or added custom. Future upgrades suggest new additions without re-suggesting declined items.
- `skills/migrations/` directory convention for version-specific post-upgrade agent directives.
- 20 unit tests and 5 E2E tests for the check-update command, covering version comparison, changelog extraction, CLI wiring, and real GitHub API interaction.
- E2E test DB lifecycle documentation in CLAUDE.md: spin up, run tests, tear down. No orphaned containers.

### Changed

- `detectInstallMethod()` exported from `upgrade.ts` for reuse by `check-update`.

### Fixed

- Semver comparison in changelog extraction was missing major-version guard, causing incorrect changelog entries to appear when crossing major version boundaries.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- `mbrain doctor` command with `--json` output. Checks pgvector extension, RLS policies, schema version, embedding coverage, and connection health. Agents can self-diagnose issues.
- Pluggable storage backends: S3, Supabase Storage, and local filesystem. Choose where binary files live independently of the database. Configured via `mbrain init` or environment variables.
- Parallel import with per-worker engine instances. Large brain imports now use multiple database connections concurrently instead of a single serial pipeline.
- Import resume checkpoints. If `mbrain import` is interrupted, it picks up where it left off instead of re-importing everything.
- Automatic schema migration runner. On connect, mbrain detects the current schema version and applies any pending migrations without manual intervention.
- Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables with `BYPASSRLS` safety check. Every query goes through RLS policies.
- `--json` flag on `mbrain init` and `mbrain import` for machine-readable output. Agents can parse structured results instead of scraping CLI text.
- File migration CLI (`mbrain files migrate`) for moving files between storage backends. Two-way-door: test with `--dry-run`, migrate incrementally.
- Bulk chunk INSERT for faster page writes. Chunks are inserted in a single statement instead of one-at-a-time.
- Supabase smart URL parsing: automatically detects and converts IPv6-only pooler URLs to the correct connection format.
- 56 new unit tests covering doctor, storage backends, file migration, import resume, slug validation, setup branching, Supabase admin, and YAML parsing. Test suite grew from 9 to 19 test files.
- E2E tests for parallel import concurrency and all new features.

### Fixed

- `validateSlug` now accepts any filename characters (spaces, unicode, special chars) instead of rejecting non-alphanumeric slugs. Apple Notes and other real-world filenames import cleanly.
- Import resilience: files over 5MB are skipped with a warning instead of crashing the pipeline. Errors in individual files no longer abort the entire import.
- `mbrain init` detects IPv6-only Supabase URLs and adds the required `pgvector` check during setup.
- E2E test fixture counts, CLI argument parsing, and doctor exit codes cleaned up.

### Changed

- Setup skill and README rewritten for agent-first developer experience.
- Maintain skill updated with RLS verification, schema health checks, and `nohup` hints for large embedding jobs.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- Contract-first architecture: single `operations.ts` defines ~30 shared operations. CLI, MCP, and tools-json all generated from the same source. Zero drift.
- `OperationError` type with structured error codes (`page_not_found`, `invalid_params`, `embedding_failed`, etc.). Agents can self-correct.
- `dry_run` parameter on all mutating operations. Agents preview before committing.
- `importFromContent()` split from `importFile()`. Both share the same chunk+embed+tag pipeline, but `importFromContent` works from strings (used by `put_page`). Wrapped in `engine.transaction()`.
- Idempotency hash now includes ALL fields (title, type, frontmatter, tags), not just compiled_truth + timeline. Metadata-only edits no longer silently skipped.
- `get_page` now supports optional `fuzzy: true` for slug resolution. Returns `resolved_slug` so callers know what happened.
- `query` operation now supports `expand` toggle (default true). Both CLI and MCP get the same control.
- 10 new operations wired up: `put_raw_data`, `get_raw_data`, `resolve_slugs`, `get_chunks`, `log_ingest`, `get_ingest_log`, `file_list`, `file_upload`, `file_url`.
- OpenClaw bundle plugin manifest (`openclaw.plugin.json`) with config schema, MCP server config, and skill listing.
- GitHub Actions CI: test on push/PR, multi-platform release builds (macOS arm64 + Linux x64) on version tags.
- `mbrain init --non-interactive` flag for plugin mode (accepts config via flags/env vars, no TTY required).
- Post-upgrade version verification in `mbrain upgrade`.
- Parity test (`test/parity.test.ts`) verifies structural contract between operations, CLI, and MCP.
- New `setup` skill replacing `install`: auto-provision Supabase via CLI, AGENTS.md injection, target TTHW < 2 min.
- E2E test suite against real Postgres+pgvector. 13 realistic fixtures (miniature brain with people, companies, deals, meetings, concepts), 14 test suites covering all operations, search quality benchmarks, idempotency stress tests, schema validation, and full setup journey verification.
- GitHub Actions E2E workflow: Tier 1 (mechanical) on every PR, Tier 2 (LLM skills via OpenClaw) nightly.
- `docker-compose.test.yml` and `.env.testing.example` for local E2E development.

### Fixed

- Schema loader in `db.ts` broke on PL/pgSQL trigger functions containing semicolons inside `$$` blocks. Replaced per-statement execution with single `conn.unsafe()` call.
- `traverseGraph` query failed with "could not identify equality operator for type json" when using `SELECT DISTINCT` with `json_agg`. Changed to `jsonb_agg`.

### Changed

- `src/mcp/server.ts` rewritten from ~233 to ~80 lines. Tool definitions and dispatch generated from operations[].
- `src/cli.ts` rewritten. Shared operations auto-registered from operations[]. CLI-only commands (init, upgrade, import, export, files, embed) kept as manual registrations.
- `tools-json` output now generated FROM operations[]. Third contract surface eliminated.
- All 7 skills rewritten with tool-agnostic language. Works with both CLI and MCP plugin contexts.
- File schema: `storage_url` column dropped, `storage_path` is the only identifier. URLs generated on demand via `file_url` operation.
- Config loading: env vars (`MBRAIN_DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) override config file values. Plugin config injected via env vars.

### Removed

- 12 command files migrated to operations.ts: get.ts, put.ts, delete.ts, list.ts, search.ts, query.ts, health.ts, stats.ts, tags.ts, link.ts, timeline.ts, version.ts.
- `storage_url` column from files table.

## [0.2.0.2] - 2026-04-07

### Changed

- Rewrote recommended brain schema doc with expanded architecture: database layer (entity registry, event ledger, fact store, relationship graph) presented as the core architecture, entity identity and deduplication, enrichment source ordering, epistemic discipline rules, worked examples showing full ingestion chains, concurrency guidance, and browser budget. Smoothed language for open-source readability.

## [0.2.0.1] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- Recommended brain schema doc (`docs/MBRAIN_RECOMMENDED_SCHEMA.md`): full MECE directory structure, compiled truth + timeline pages, enrichment pipeline, resolver decision tree, skill architecture, and cron job recommendations. The OpenClaw paste now links to this as step 5.

### Changed

- First-time experience rewritten. "Try it" section shows your own data, not fictional PG essays. OpenClaw paste references the GitHub repo, includes bun install fallback, and has the agent pick a dynamic query based on what it imported.
- Removed all references to `data/kindling/` (a demo corpus directory that never existed).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- You can now keep your brain current with `mbrain sync`, which uses git's own diff machinery to process only what changed. No more 30-second full directory walks when 3 files changed.
- Watch mode (`mbrain sync --watch`) polls for changes and syncs automatically. Set it and forget it.
- Binary file management with `mbrain files` commands (list, upload, sync, verify). Store images, PDFs, and audio in Supabase Storage instead of clogging your git repo.
- Install skill (`skills/install/SKILL.md`) that walks you through setup from scratch, including Supabase CLI magic path for zero-copy-paste onboarding.
- Import and sync now share a checkpoint. Run `mbrain import`, then `mbrain sync`, and it picks up right where import left off. Zero gap.
- Tag reconciliation on reimport. If you remove a tag from your markdown, it actually gets removed from the database now.
- `mbrain config show` redacts database passwords so you can safely share your config.
- `updateSlug` engine method preserves page identity (page_id, chunks, embeddings) across renames. Zero re-embedding cost.
- `sync_brain` MCP tool returns structured results so agents know exactly what changed.
- 20 new sync tests (39 total across 3 test files)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- Pluggable engine interface (`BrainEngine`) with full Postgres + pgvector implementation
- 25+ CLI commands: init, get, put, delete, list, search, query, import, export, embed, stats, health, link/unlink/backlinks/graph, tag/untag/tags, timeline/timeline-add, history/revert, config, upgrade, serve, call
- MCP stdio server with 20 tools mirroring all CLI operations
- 3-tier chunking: recursive (delimiter-aware), semantic (Savitzky-Golay boundary detection), LLM-guided (Claude Haiku topic shifts)
- Hybrid search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion merging vector + keyword results
- Multi-query expansion via Claude Haiku (2 alternative phrasings per query)
- 4-layer dedup pipeline: by source, cosine similarity, type diversity, per-page cap
- OpenAI embedding service (text-embedding-3-large, 1536 dims) with batch support and exponential backoff
- Postgres schema with pgvector HNSW, tsvector (trigger-based, spans timeline_entries), pg_trgm fuzzy slug matching
- Smart slug resolution for reads (fuzzy match via pg_trgm)
- Page version control with snapshot, history, and revert
- Typed links with recursive CTE graph traversal (max depth configurable)
- Brain health dashboard (embed coverage, stale pages, orphans, dead links)
- Stale alert annotations in search results
- Supabase init wizard with CLI auto-provision fallback
- Slug validation to prevent path traversal on export
- 6 fat markdown skills: ingest, query, maintain, enrich, briefing, migrate
- ClawHub manifest for skill distribution
- Full design docs: MBRAIN_V0 spec, pluggable engine architecture, SQLite engine plan
