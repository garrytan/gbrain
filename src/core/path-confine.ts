 * Shared symlink-safe path-confinement + dotfile-trust helpers.
 *
 * Consolidates the realpath-containment idiom that previously lived only in
 * `sources-ops.ts` (`isPathContained`) and `validateUploadPath`
 * (`operations.ts`), and adds `isTrustedDotfile` — the multi-user-host trust
 * gate for walk-up routing dotfiles (`.gbrain-source` / `.gbrain-mount`).
 *
 * Threat model (POSIX multi-user host): an attacker who can write into a
 * shared ancestor directory of the victim's CWD (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`,
 * `/dev/shm`, shared NFS/SMB, CI runner volumes, container bind-mounts) can
 * plant a routing dotfile that silently retargets the victim's reads/writes
 * to the attacker's source/brain. The walk-up resolvers must therefore refuse
 * a dotfile they can't prove the victim (or root) owns. (#418/#419)
 *
 * Fail-closed: any stat/realpath error → not trusted / not contained. The one
 * documented exception is platforms without numeric uid (Windows), where the
 * multi-user-POSIX threat model does not apply and `isTrustedDotfile` trusts
 * by default so existing single-user setups keep working.
