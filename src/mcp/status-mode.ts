/**
 * Status-only serve (agent operator contract v1, F4). `gbrain serve` (stdio)
 * never exits before the MCP handshake: when the brain is locked by another
 * server, missing, or its config is unreadable, it completes the handshake
 * with exactly one tool, `gbrain_status`, that says what is wrong, names the
 * lock owner / brain path, and gives the fix plus the words to relay.
 *
 * Recovery: the engine is a lazy proxy (the degraded-engine shape) whose
 * reconnect is gated here: the gate re-reads config and `peekLock()` only
 * (file reads, no lock attempt) and refuses while a live holder or a missing
 * config remains; lock acquisition happens only inside a tool call, at most
 * once per 5 s, only with no live holder. On success serve boots its engine
 * dependents and sends `tools/list_changed`; the full catalog replaces
 * `gbrain_status`.
 *
 * Dependency-light on purpose: server.ts imports it on every boot.
